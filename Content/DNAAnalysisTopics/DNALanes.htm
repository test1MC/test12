        <h1>Lanes Group</h1>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Lane location rectangle" />When a <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/DNA_Gel_Analysis.flsnp" /> is added to an image, equally 
 spaced lanes are created in a Lane Location Rectangle using the number of lanes specified 
 in the number of lanes field in the <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/Lanes_group.flsnp" />. The lane widths are based 
 on the band widths found in the image.</p>
        <p>To change the lanes, use the controls in the <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/Lanes_group.flsnp" /> to redraw the boundary and/or to change the number of lanes.</p>
        <p class="note">If there are already lanes defined on the current analysis, redrawing the boundary deletes those lanes. Nothing is preserved from the deleted lanes such as edited bands.</p>
        <p>To redraw the boundary:</p>
        <ol style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li>Click the <MadCap:keyword term="Redraw boundary" /><MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/Redraw_Boundary_button.flsnp" />.</li>
            <li>Click the upper left corner of the area to define and 
 drag the boundary box to the bottom right of the area to define, then 
 release the mouse button.</li>
            <li>Use the <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/Number_counter.flsnp" /> to increase or decrease the number of lanes. You can use 
 the Up and Down arrows to increase or decrease the number, or type the 
 number of lanes in the text field.</li>
            <li class="nb">
                <img src="../Resources/Images/IS5.0-LanesGroup-UpDownArrows.png" alt="Image Studio 5.0 Location of Text Field and Up and Down Arrows for adjusting number of DNA gel lanes" style="width: 312px; height: 123px;" class="width013pct" />
            </li>
            <li>After the lanes are defined, you can manually fine tune 
 them by moving the lanes. Click the lane to select it, then drag the top 
 or the bottom to tilt it or hold down the shift key to move the whole 
 lane left or right to a new position. To select more than one lane to 
 move or tilt, hold down the <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/CTRL.flsnp" /> 
 key while clicking (selecting) the lanes. Move the cursor to the top or 
 bottom of the lane and when the cursor turns to the four-pointed arrow, 
 drag it left or right to tilt the group; or hold down the <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/SHIFT.flsnp" /> 
 key, drag the cursor left or right to move the group. (See illustration 
 in the Lanes group section of Western Analysis.)</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="note">During the <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/Find_Bands.flsnp" /> process, the  lanes are also adjusted to optimize their intersection with the bands.</p>
        <p>After band finding is 
 complete, if you move or resize a lane, the band-finding process is repeated 
 using the same parameters.</p>
