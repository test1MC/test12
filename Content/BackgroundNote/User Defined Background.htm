        <h2>How the User-Defined Method Calculates Bkgnd and Signal</h2>
        <p>
            <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/Bkgnd.flsnp" />: The <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/User-defined.flsnp" /> background method finds the average pixel intensity within a shape placed by the user to calculate background.</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/Signal.flsnp" />: The signal is calculated by finding the <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/Total.flsnp" /> for the shape and subtracting the product of the average intensity of the pixels in the user-defined background and the <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/Area.flsnp" />.</p>
        <h2>Using the User-Defined Background Method</h2>
        <p>Multiple shapes can be designated as background by holding down the CTRL key and clicking each shape individually or clicking and dragging a rectangle around the shapes. If multiple shapes are selected, they will be averaged together to find the background.</p>
        <p>Selected shapes should be designated as background by clicking <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/Assign.flsnp" /> in the <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/Background group.flsnp" /> of the <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/Analysis tab.flsnp" />. The <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/Assign.flsnp" /> button for add-on applications may also be located in that application's <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/Analysis tab.flsnp" /> (<i>e.g.</i> the <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/Small Animal Image Application Tab.flsnp" />).</p>
