        <h1 MadCap:autonum="I. ">Plate, Grid, and In-Cell Western™ Assay Background Methods</h1>
        <p>The <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/Plate.flsnp" />, <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/Plate Array.flsnp" />, <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/Grid.flsnp" />, and <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/Grid Array.flsnp" /> applications are available with the <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/Grid_Analysis_Key.flsnp" />. The <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/InCellWestern_NoTM.flsnp" /> Application Specific Analysis key is separate, but its background methods are similar to the <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/Plate.flsnp" /> and <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/Grid.flsnp" /> based applications.</p>
        <p>The following points are important for <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/Plate.flsnp" />, <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/Grid.flsnp" />, and <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/InCellWestern_NoTM.flsnp" /> background methods:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Some methods require specific wells to be designated as background. Background wells should be treated experimentally such that they can be used to determine background caused by nonspecific binding of secondary antibodies, labels, or dyes.</li>
            <li>Saturated (bright blue pixels when viewed in grayscale) pixels may appear in a well. <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/Trim Signal.flsnp" /> can be used to discard these saturated pixels from calculations.</li>
            <li>Using black microwell plates provides the clearest contrast between wells and the surrounding plate. If clear plates are used, a bright halo will appear around the wells. Make sure that the shape designating a well does not include this halo.</li>
        </ul>
