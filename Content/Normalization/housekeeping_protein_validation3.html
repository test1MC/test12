        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Perform a Western blot with a serial dilution of sample (an 8-12 point, two-fold serial dilution is a good place to start).</p>
                <p> Use a two-color Western blot protocol (see <a href="https://www.licor.com/bio/applications/quantitative_western_blots/workflows.html">licor.com/WesternWorkflow</a>).</p>
                <p class="note">The dilution series should include samples with concentrations above and below the concentration you expect to use.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Quantify signal from the target and HKP loading control.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Export quantification data to a spreadsheet program.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Plot protein concentration vs signal for both the target and HKP.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Find a linear trendline for the target and HKP loading control that meets your requirements for correlation strength.</p>
                <p class="note">You will probably need to iteratively exclude high and low points from each trendline until you find a range of data points that produces an appropriate linear range.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Determine the median concentration from the combined target and HKP linear range.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Based on the median concentration, select a sample concentration for your experiment that will allow your target and HKP to be detected within the same linear range (<MadCap:xref href="#hkp-normalization-trendline" class="figure-x">Figure 1</MadCap:xref>).</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Under many circumstances, the median concentration will be a good place to start.</li>
                    <li>If you hypothesize that your target will be strongly upregulated or down-regulated, you may need to start with a concentration above or below the median to ensure your target and HKP are within the same linear range for all your samples.</li>
                </ul>

				</figure>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="warning">If the median concentration is outside the linear range for the target or HKP, find another HKP or use another normalization method (such as <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/revert_tps.flsnp" />).</p>
