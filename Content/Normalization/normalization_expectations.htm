        <p>Normalization is a critical part of attaining reproducible data from quantitative Western blots. Recent changes, notably updates to the <i>Journal of Biological Chemistry's</i> submission guidelines <MadCap:xref href="references.html#http://w3" class="inline">(<span style="color: #63abdd;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>1</u></span>)</MadCap:xref>, necessitate a closer look at traditionally accepted normalization practices.</p>
        <p>This guide summarizes the basic principles of normalization and explains how to use these principles to accurately normalize Western blot data using one of three different normalization strategies.</p>
        <p class="moreInfo">Throughout this guide, the <i>Journal of Biological Chemistry's</i> submission guidelines and other peer reviewed normalization method papers will be referenced to provide context and sources of additional information.</p>
        <p class="note">This guide is a general overview of normalization principles, not a specific protocol. The reader must apply the general information from this guide to specific protocols as appropriate.</p>
