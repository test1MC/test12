                <p>Check antibody data sheets to ensure the two primary antibodies recognize different regions of the protein.</p>

            <li>
                <p>Polyclonal pan-specific antibodies are less likely to experience epitope interference. Even if one epitope is blocked, the polyclonal antibody may be able to bind other epitopes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>You may wish to empirically verify that epitope interference is not occurring.</p>
                <p>For example, in 2015, Bakkenist et. al. <MadCap:xref href="references.html#Bakkenis" class="inline">(<span style="color: #63abdd;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>5</u></span>)</MadCap:xref> demonstrated one method that can be used to evaluate binding interference between primary antibody pairs. Identical blots were incubated with modification and pan-specific antibodies separately (singleplex), or with both antibodies simultaneously (multiplex). Relatively little variation in signal intensity was measured between pan-specific antibody from multiplex and singleplex blots.</p>
