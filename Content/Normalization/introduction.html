        <h1 MadCap:autonum="I. ">The Ideal World vs The Real World</h1>
        <p>Under ideal circumstances, normalization would not be necessary for Western blots. Each sample would contain a uniform, consistent amount of sample protein, and the total protein signal measured for each sample would be the same. The signal for your target protein might be the same in each sample, or it might differ based on your experimental treatment.</p>

            <figcaption MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Figure 1. &lt;/b&gt;">This illustration shows signal from an ideal Western blot. Although the target protein expression may vary, the same total protein was loaded for each sample.</figcaption>

        <p>However, in the real world, it is not possible to load exactly the same amount of protein from each sample. Even if it were possible to get the same amount of protein from each sample into a gel, transfer efficiency from the gel to the blot will be different from lane to lane. Further, detection method limitations may affect the accuracy of detection.</p>

            <figcaption MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Figure 2. &lt;/b&gt;">In this illustration of signal detected on a "real" blot, the target protein varies and the total protein varies as well.</figcaption>
