        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Run a Western blot with equal concentrations of treated and untreated samples with the same range of doses you plan to use.</p>
                <p>Since a suitable HKP has not yet been identified for normalization, use one or more of the following methods to ensure the most consistent possible loading.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Protein Concentration Assay:</strong> Use BCA, or a similar concentration assay, to quantify sample concentration and adjust for even loading.</li>
                    <li><strong>Duplicate Gel:</strong> Stain a duplicate gel with Coomassie stain, and use NIR fluorescence to quantify protein and check for even loading.</li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Total Protein Stain:</strong> Stain the membrane with a total protein stain to quantify protein and check for even loading.</p>
                        <p class="moreInfo">The Odyssey Loading Indicator provides a method for determining consistency of loading and transfer.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Probe for each candidate HKP.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Select a HKP that is expressed consistently across treated and untreated samples for further evaluation (continue with <MadCap:xref href="housekeeping_protein_validation3.html">"Verify that HKP is detectable within same linear range as target" on page&#160;1</MadCap:xref>).</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <!--<p>Ensure the membrane is not saturated and that linear range of your detection system has not been exceeded. Remember, saturated signals will make strong bands appear to be similar in intensity, even if they are not.</p>-->
