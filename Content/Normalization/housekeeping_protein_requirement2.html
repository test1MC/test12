        <h1 class="requirement" MadCap:autonum="Requirement 1: ">HKP May Not Be Detectable Within Linear Range of Target</h1>
        <p><strong>Many frequently studied target proteins are low-abundance compared with ubiquitous HKP and structural proteins</strong> <MadCap:xref href="references.html#Aldridge" class="inline">(<span style="color: #63abdd;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>2</u></span>)</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p>If your target is low-abundance, but your HKP is highly abundant, the two different proteins will produce bands with very different intensities. This makes it likely that you will need to load a large amount of sample to detect your target, which will cause your HKP bands to become saturated. Once HKP saturation occurs, accurate normalization can no longer be conducted.</p>
        <p>Saturated bands cannot be quantified, because the relationship between the amount of light recorded and the amount of protein in the corresponding band no longer holds. The HKP is no longer an accurate indicator of sample loading.</p>
        <p class="moreInfo">If you need to load a large amount of sample to detect a low-abundance target, using a low-abundance HKP like COX IV may help prevent HKP saturation <MadCap:xref href="references.html#licor.co4" class="inline">(<span style="color: #63abdd;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>2</u></span>)</MadCap:xref>. Remember, choose a HKP that accurately represents your protein type (mitochondrial HKPs should be used for mitochondrial targets).</p>
        <p>No matter which HKP you choose, you must always validate your choice of HKP carefully before use.</p>
