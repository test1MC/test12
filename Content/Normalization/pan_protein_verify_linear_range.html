        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Perform a Western blot with a serial dilution of sample.</p>
                <p class="note">The dilution series should include samples with concentrations above and below the concentration you expect to use.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Quantify signal from the pan-specific antibody and modification-specific antibody.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Export quantification data to a spreadsheet program.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Plot the protein concentration vs signal for both modification- and pan-specific signals.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Find a linear trendline for the pan- and modification-specific proteins that meets your requirements for correlation strength.</p>
                <p class="note">You will probably need to iteratively exclude high and low points from each trendline until you find a range of data points that produces an appropriate linear range.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Determine the median concentration from the combined pan- and modification-specific linear range.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Based on the median concentration, select a sample concentration for your experiment that will allow your target to be detected within the linear range for every sample.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Under many circumstances, the median concentration will be a good place to start.</li>
            <li>If you hypothesize that your target will be strongly upregulated or down regulated, you may need to start with a concentration above or below the median to ensure you are working within the correct linear range for all your samples.</li>
        </ul>
