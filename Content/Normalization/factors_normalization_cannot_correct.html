        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Signal saturation:</strong> Signal saturation occurs when signal surpasses the intensity limit that your detection system can record. Film saturates very easily. On film, strong bands become saturated very quickly, and many digital imagers are also limited by signal saturation.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Membrane saturation:</strong> The blotting membrane does not have an unlimited capacity to retain protein. When sample proteins exceed the maximum binding capacity in an area of the membrane, membrane saturation occurs. Although there may be more sample protein present, the excess protein cannot be retained in that area and is washed away. Membrane saturation may result in under-estimation of strong bands and may compromise the accuracy of the data.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>A normalization factor cannot be reused between blots.</strong> Normalization must be performed separately for each blot.</p>
