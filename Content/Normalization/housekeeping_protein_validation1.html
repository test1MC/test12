        <h1 class="step" MadCap:autonum="Step 1. ">Avoid Detection Interference: Choose HKPs with Appropriate MW</h1>
        <p>If you plan to use chemiluminescence detection, begin by ensuring the HKPs you are considering for normalization are not close in MW to your target. The target and HKP must not comigrate.</p>
        <p class="note">If you are using two-color near-infrared fluorescence detection on an Odyssey Imaging System, there is no need to worry about this step.</p>
