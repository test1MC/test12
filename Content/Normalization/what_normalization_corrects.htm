        <p>The normalization methods described in this document can accurately account for the following sources of variance, assuming they meet the core requirements for accurate normalization.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Unequal protein sample concentration:</strong> For normalization to be effective, a protein concentration assay must be used to adjust sample concentrations and make sample loading as consistent as possible.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Inconsistent sample loading across the gel:</strong> Sample viscosity and pipetting inconsistency can introduce variation from lane to lane.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Transfer variation:</strong> Temperature, membrane binding capacity, membrane position in the transfer tank, and edge effects can all contribute to transfer variability, even when appropriate levels of protein are loaded. You may need to optimize transfer buffer conditions, voltage, transfer time, or other factors.</p>
                <p class="moreInfo">The Odyssey Loading Indicator provides a method for determining consistency of loading and transfer.</p>

            <!--<li>
                <p><strong>Signal saturation can prevent accurate quantitation.</strong> Signal saturation occurs when signal surpasses the intensity limit that your detection system can record. Film saturates very easily. On film, strong bands become saturated very quickly, and many digital imagers are also limited by signal saturation.</p>
