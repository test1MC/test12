        <h1 MadCap:autonum="I. ">Normalization Basics</h1>
        <p>Accuracy in quantitative immunoblotting relies on appropriate normalization and minimizing error. To minimize error, you must use a protein concentration assay (such as BCA) to adjust sample concentrations and make sample loading as consistent as possible.</p>
        <p>Normalization is necessary because small lane-to-lane and sample-to-sample variations are unavoidable in Western blotting, even if you do carefully minimize error.</p>
