        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Perform a Western blot with a serial dilution of sample.</p>
                <p>See the <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/revert_tps.flsnp" /> one-color protocol <a href="http://licor.com/revert">licor.com/revert</a>.</p>
                <p class="note">The dilution series should include samples with concentrations above and below the concentration you expect to use.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Quantify signal from the target and the total sample protein  (stained with <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/revert_tps.flsnp" />).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Export quantification data to a spreadsheet program.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Plot the protein amount vs signal for both the target and <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/revert_tps.flsnp" />.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Find a linear trendline for the target and <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/revert_tps.flsnp" /> that meets your requirements for correlation strength.</p>
                <p class="note">You will probably need to iteratively exclude high and low points from each trendline until you find a range of data points that produces an appropriate linear range.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Determine the median concentration from the combined target and <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/revert_tps.flsnp" /> linear range.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Based on the median concentration, select a sample concentration for your experiment that will allow your target and <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/revert_tps.flsnp" /> to be detected within the same linear range.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Under many circumstances, the median concentration will be a good place to start.</li>
            <li>If you hypothesize that your target will be strongly upregulated or down regulated, you may need to start with a concentration above or below the median to ensure your target and <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/revert_tps.flsnp" /> are within the same linear range for all your samples.</li>
        </ul>
        <!--<ol>
            <li><p>Run a dilution series of lysate and stain with REVERT Total Protein Stain.</p></li>
            <li><p>Quantify the total protein stain.</p></li>
            <li><p>Ensure you get a linear line that is proportional to the dilution factor used in preparing the samples.</p></li>
