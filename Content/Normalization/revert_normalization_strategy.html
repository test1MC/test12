        <p>The <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/revert_tps.flsnp" /> strategy is used to normalize target protein to the total amount of sample protein per lane.</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/revert_tps.flsnp" /> is a membrane stain that fluoresces at 700 nm. <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/revert_tps.flsnp" /> does not covalently modify sample proteins and therefore does not affect antibody binding or quantification. With a near-infrared fluorescence imager, you can image the total protein stained with <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/revert_tps.flsnp" /> in the 700 nm channel and image target protein in the 800 nm channel on the same blot. You can also remove the total protein stain and reprocess the blot to detect two different targets in the 700 and 800 nm channels (the full protocol is available here <a href="https://www.licor.com/bio/products/reagents/revert_total_protein_stain/protocols.html">licor.com/revert</a>).</p>
        <p>With a total protein stain, you will be able to monitor protein transfer across the entire blot at all molecular weights. This will allow you to determine if there are any irregularities that indicate you should run the blot again to get more robust results.</p>
