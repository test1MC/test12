        <p>Internal loading controls and normalization are critical for quantitative immunoblotting. An accurate loading control will display a linear relationship between signal intensity and sample loading. When implemented, an effective normalization strategy should correct for variability in all stages of the immunoblotting process, including the transfer of sample proteins to membrane. It should also be compatible with immunodetection of target proteins and other types of downstream analysis.</p>
