        <h1 MadCap:autonum="I. ">Housekeeping Protein Strategy</h1>
        <p>The housekeeping protein (HKP) strategy is used to normalize the target to a single unrelated endogenous protein that is present in all samples and is unaffected by experimental conditions or treatments. Common housekeeping proteins include GAPDH, actin, and tubulin, but the type of HKP used should be chosen to represent the target (if the target is mitochondrial, choose a mitochondrial HKP).</p>
        <p>The HKP normalization strategy requires more extensive validation prior to use than the other methods mentioned in this guide. Since only one protein is employed for reference, the accuracy of the normalization procedure will be compromised by variations in the single HKP's expression.</p>
        <!--         <p>Two problems can arise from the use of HKPs for normalization.</p>-->
