            ]]><a name="hkp-validation-sample-data"></a><strong>HKP expression may be affected by experimental treatments.</strong> Jurkat cells were treated with etoposide to induce apoptosis. Cell lysate samples were loaded in triplicate. Relative signal intensities are shown. Intensity of tubulin bands (A) decreased by 16% across the blot, suggesting that etoposide treatment may lower the expression of this HKP. Total protein staining (B) and Odyssey Loading Indicator (C) showed consistent signals in all samples, confirming that sample protein loading and volume were uniform across the gel. This indicates that the observed changes in HKP band intensity reflect actual change in tubulin levels in the etoposide-treated cells, not variation in sample loading.
