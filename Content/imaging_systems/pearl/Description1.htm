        <p>The purpose of the Pearl Imager Clean Box is to provide a HEPA-filtered closed environment for mice requiring added protection from exposure to pathogens.</p>
        <p>The lower portion of the Clean Box is an imaging bed with a heater plate similar to the standard Pearl imaging bed. The heater plate can be used to maintain the body temperature of the mouse when the Clean Box is locked in place on either the Pearl Imager or Pearl Docking Station. The handle of the Clean Box is used to lock it in place using the same “rotate down” method as the standard imaging bed. When locked in place, anesthesia gas will be supplied to the mouse via the standard Pearl nose cone. HEPA filters are provided for both the Pearl Imager and Pearl Docking Station to protect the mouse by filtering the anesthesia gas. When the Clean Box is undocked, the gas ports automatically close.</p>
        <p>The Pearl Clean Box window is a specially coated cell cast acrylic window for optimum light transmission and durability. The coating on the exterior surface of the window will help minimize smudging and scratching. The interior surface is coated to minimize scratches.</p>
        <p><b>Important:</b> Do not discard the clear protective cover for the Clean Box during unpacking. The cover protects the imaging window of the Clean Box during storage and transfer from the Docking Station to the Pearl Imager.</p>
