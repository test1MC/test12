        <p>The Pearl Docking Station is an optional, external accessory that duplicates many of the features of the <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Manuals.trilogy-manual,Manuals.impulse-manual">Pearl Imager</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Manuals.pearl-accessories-manual">Pearl<sup>®</sup> Imager</MadCap:conditionalText> imaging drawer. The main features and functions of the Docking Station are listed below.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Duplicates the docking hardware in the Pearl Imager imaging drawer, allowing an accessory imaging bed to be locked in place on the docking station similar to the Pearl imaging drawer.</li>
            <li>Provides temperature and anesthesia gas control to a Pearl accessory imaging bed outside of the <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Pearl_Imager.flsnp" />, allowing animals to be prepared for imaging at an external station.</li>
            <li>Warms the heater plate in any of the Pearl accessory imaging beds (when docked) to 38 °C so animals can be placed on warm imaging beds before transfer to the Pearl Imager.</li>
            <li>Provides a rotameter, isoflurane scrubber, and anesthesia gas flow system similar to the Pearl Imager when an accessory imaging bed is locked in place on the docking station.</li>
        </ul>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Manuals.pearl-accessories-manual">This chapter provides information on assembly and operation of the Pearl Docking Station only. The remaining chapters provide specific operational details on each of the accessory imaging beds. Information on the standard Pearl Imaging Bed is not provided in this manual since it can be found in the Pearl Imager Operator's Manual.</p>
