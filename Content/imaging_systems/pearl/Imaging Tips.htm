        <h1 MadCap:autonum="Chapter 1: ">Imaging Tips</h1>
        <h2>Hair vs. Shaved Animal</h2>
        <p>If working with a haired mouse model (i.e., something other than nude mice), shave the animal in the region of interest prior to imaging. Up to 50% of the signal is blocked when imaging through hair. Hair removal can be accomplished by shaving (i.e., mustache shavers work well) or by the use of Nair<sup>®</sup> hair remover.</p>
        <h2>Diet Considerations<a name="_bookmark23"></a></h2>
        <p>Background levels in the abdominal region can be significantly lowered by considering what diet to feed mice before imaging. The application note entitled “In Vivo Animal Imaging Diet Considerations”, included with the Pearl Application Protocols Manual, illustrates why purified diets are an excellent choice for near-infrared optical imaging. Approximately 4 days are necessary to clear fluorescence from the abdominal region when switching mice from a regular diet to a purified diet. The application note also discusses lower cost alternative diets and their effectiveness in background reduction.</p>
        <h2>Mouse Recovery Procedure</h2>
        <p>If a mouse wakes up during imaging, the design of the imaging drawer makes it difficult for the mouse to escape the drawer. If the imaging drawer is closed when you discover the mouse has awakened, press the power button to turn off the <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Pearl_R_Imaging_System.flsnp" /> and slowly open the imaging drawer manually by pulling on the drawer handle. If the mouse is still in the imaging drawer, the mouse should be easy to capture.</p>
        <p>If the imaging drawer is open and the mouse is not present, the mouse has escaped into the Pearl Imaging System instrument enclosure. The lower rear access panel can be removed to retrieve the mouse using the procedure described below.</p>
        <p>Procedure:</p>
        <ol class="paren">
            <li>Place the nose cone plug in the imaging bed nose cone to stop anesthesia gas from escaping through the nose cone. Alternately, gas flow can be stopped from the external anesthesia system or by removing the imaging bed.</li>
            <li>With the imaging drawer open, briefly press the power button on the Pearl Imaging System front panel and wait for the instrument to turn off (if not already powered off).</li>
            <li><b>Disconnect the power cord from rear of the instrument.</b>
            </li>
            <li class="NoNum">
                <p class="warning"><b>CAUTION:</b> Do not remove the lower rear panel before the power is turned off and the power cord is disconnected.</p>
            </li>
            <li>The lower rear access panel is held in place by six screws (<MadCap:xref href="#remove" class="XreftoParanum">Figure 1&#8209;1</MadCap:xref>) that are permanently attached to the panel. Use a screwdriver to loosen all six screws, then pull the access panel straight back and off the instrument (<MadCap:xref href="#pearl" class="XreftoParanum">Figure 1&#8209;2</MadCap:xref>).</li>
        </ol>

        </p>
        <p class="figure" MadCap:autonum="Figure 1&#8209;1"><a name="remove"></a>. To remove the lower rear access panel, use a screwdriver to loosen the six panel screws circled in white.</p>
        <ol class="paren" MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Locate the mouse. If the mouse is not visible immediately, look upward on the left and right sides to see if the mouse has climbed upward and is sitting on one of the ledges formed by the enclosure. Use a flashlight if necessary.</li>
            <li>Before reaching inside the instrument, touch the chrome connector panel (<MadCap:xref href="#touch" class="XreftoParanum">Figure 1&#8209;3</MadCap:xref>) to discharge any static electricity. To reduce the chance of static discharge, do not wear rubber gloves while attempting to remove the mouse, and, whenever possible, keep one hand on the chrome connector panel to maintain a connection to chassis ground.</li>
