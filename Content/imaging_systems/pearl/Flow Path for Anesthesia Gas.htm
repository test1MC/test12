        <h1 MadCap:autonum="Chapter 1: ">Flow Path for Anesthesia Gas</h1>
        <p>The flow of isoflurane gas through a typical system consisting of a Pearl Imaging System and the <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/SmartFlow.flsnp" /> Anesthesia System is illustrated in <MadCap:xref href="#schem" class="XreftoParanum">Figure 1&#8209;1</MadCap:xref>. When using an anesthesia system other than the <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/SmartFlow.flsnp" /> System, the anesthesia system should be vented to prevent pressure build-up if the Pearl Imaging System rotameter is closed or the imaging bed is removed. Either of these actions stops the flow inside the Pearl Imaging System instrument. The Pearl Imaging System instrument itself is protected by a 10 psi relief valve that releases excess pressure to the exhaust port when the imaging bed is removed or the imaging bed handle is in the vertical position.</p>
