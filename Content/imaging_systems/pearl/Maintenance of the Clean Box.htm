        <h1 MadCap:autonum="Chapter 1: "><a name="top"></a>Maintenance of the Clean Box Window</h1>
        <p>Proper care and maintenance are important to preserve the optical characteristics of the Pearl Clean Box window. The following instructions are recommended for the proper care of the window.</p>
        <h2>Scratches</h2>
        <p>The window top and bottom surfaces are treated with a hard coating that aids in scratch prevention under normal use. However, the window can still be scratched by dirt or other foreign objects. Reasonable care should be taken to avoid scratching the window surfaces. Do not use paper towels or similar products to clean the surfaces. Compressed, clean dry air is the preferred method of removing foreign debris. If compressed air does not remove the debris, a soft lint-free optical cleaning tissue should be used.</p>
        <h2>Smudging</h2>
        <p>Due to the light transmission characteristics of the window, it will be very easy to see smudges on the window surfaces. To help prevent smudging, the exterior surface of the window has an anti&#8209;smudge coating. For optimal optical performance, the interior window surface does not have this coating. Take extra care to avoid contact with the interior surface in order to prolong the lifetime of the window.</p>
        <h2>Chemicals<a name="_bookmark35"></a></h2>
        <p>Chemicals such as <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/chlorine_bleach.flsnp" />, ethanol, and isopropanol are NOT detrimental to the optical properties of the window. <b>CAUTION: The window CAN be damaged by chemicals such as toluene, acetone, benzene, ethylene dichloride, and other highly acidic or alkaline reagents.</b></p>
        <h2>Cleaning  Procedure</h2>
        <p>Dust particles are the most common contaminant. Compressed, clean dry air is recommended as a first step in cleaning the Clean Box window since dust particles can become embedded in cleaning cloths and scratch the surface.</p>
        <p>Should compressed clean dry air prove insufficient, use LI&#8209;COR<sup>®</sup> Optical Tissue and LI-COR Optical Cleaner. Apply a few drops to an optical tissue and gently clean the window with a circular motion. Follow with a second dry tissue to remove any residual liquid or streaks.</p>
        <p>For heavy duty cleaning of the window or entire Clean Box, use durable Heavy Duty Optical Wipes. A final cleaning of the window surface using the LI&#8209;COR Premium Grade Optical Tissue, as discussed above, may be required.</p>
        <p>Each of the cleaning products mentioned above can be ordered as the Clean Box Cleaning Kit or individually from LI-COR.</p>
