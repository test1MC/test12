        <p>With fluorescence based <i>in vivo</i> imaging projects, development of a targeted tracking agent begins much earlier than the actual animal imaging. <MadCap:xref href="#typical" class="XreftoParanum">Figure 1&#8209;1</MadCap:xref> illustrates the stages of development for a targeted tracking agent.</p>

        <p>Each of the development stages in <MadCap:xref href="#typical" class="XreftoParanum">Figure 1&#8209;1</MadCap:xref> are discussed in greater detail below.</p>
        <p><b>Target:</b> <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/in_vivo.flsnp" /> imaging projects typically begin with identification of a potential targeted tracking agent, or probe, such as a ligand to a receptor or an antibody specific for use with a particular model system be it cancer or a disease process.</p>
        <p><b>Label/Conjugation:</b> Once a probe has been identified, then the task becomes labeling. Does the compound lend itself to conjugation with IRDye 800CW infrared dye for imaging? If the compound is a peptide or antibody containing lysines then amines are candidates for binding with the NHS ester form of the dye. Protein labeling kits are available that use the IRDye 800CW or IRDye 680RD&#160;NHS ester to label probes. Visit <a href="http://www.licor.com/"><MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/brightSite_URL.flsnp" /></a> for the latest list of labeled agents and corresponding part numbers.</p>
        <p><b><i>In vitro</i> Assays:</b> Before starting a costly and time consuming <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/in_vivo.flsnp" /> experiment, probe specificity should be determined <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/in_vitro.flsnp" /> using the <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/LI-COR_R.flsnp" /> <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Odyssey_CLx_Imager_Rcopyright.flsnp" />, Odyssey Classic, or Odyssey Sa imaging system to perform cost-effective on-cell Western (OCW) or In-Cell Western™ (ICW) assays. Both are immunofluorescent-based assays performed in microplate format. The OCW allows monolayers of live cells to be screened with fluorescently-labeled targeted optical agents which are then fixed and stained for ratiometric analysis. The ICW uses targeted-specific primary antibodies and infrared-labeled secondary antibodies to detect target proteins in fixed cells.</p>
        <p>The more data collected <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/in_vitro.flsnp" /> to confirm the targeting agent is responding as expected, the more confident you will be when starting an animal study. What kinds of tests should be done? Binding and specificity assays are key. These will help determine if the labeled targeting agent is binding specifically to the receptor of choice.</p>
        <p><b>Clearance Studies:</b> With the knowledge that the labeled targeting agent is binding specifically, <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/in_vivo.flsnp" /> clearance studies can proceed. After confirming specificity and binding in the homogenous cell environment with the OCW or ICW, the labeled targeting agent is evaluated in “tumor-negative” and “tumor-positive” animals to determine whether any of the multiple biological systems in the body alter or affect the actions of the labeled targeting agent. Clearance studies address important questions such as: 1) Does the probe collect beyond the intended target (e.g. liver, kidneys, or bladder)? 2) How long does it take for the targeting agent to clear the animal? 3) What is the ideal probe concentration? and 4) When is the best time post-injection to image in order to achieve the best signal-to-noise ratio?</p>
        <p><b><i>in vivo</i> Studies:</b> Now a researcher can begin using the <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/IRDye_R.flsnp" /> 800CW targeting agents in their research projects with greater confidence. A typical experiment would include a negative control and a control of IRDye 800CW Carboxylate for dye-only effects, and the IRDye 800CW targeting agent. A repeat of the competition assay <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/in_vivo.flsnp" /> would be beneficial in confirming probe specificity in the animal and to identify possible complications. However, certain probes will not lend themselves to these types of studies.</p>
        <p><b>Organs:</b> More focused studies can be made of the targeting agent's localization by excising target organ(s) and imaging them on the Pearl Imager to visualize deposition of the labeled targeting agent in the organs.</p>
        <p><b>Tissue Sections:</b> To determine exact tissue localization of the biomarker, frozen, or paraffin embedded tissue sections can be scanned on a <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/LI_COR_R.flsnp" /> <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Odyssey_R_Imaging_System.flsnp" /> at a higher resolution.</p>
