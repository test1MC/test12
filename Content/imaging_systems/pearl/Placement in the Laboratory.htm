        <h1>Placement in the Laboratory</h1>
        <p>The <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Pearl_Imaging_System.flsnp" /> weighs approximately 25 kg (55 lb). The instrument should be placed on a laboratory bench that is sufficiently sturdy to bear its weight. The bench should also be able to bear the weight of the computer if the computer is to be installed beside the <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Pearl_Imaging_System.flsnp" /> instrument.</p>
        <h2>Ambient Laboratory Conditions</h2>
        <p>Place the <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Pearl_Imaging_System.flsnp" /> away from external heat sources (furnaces, windows, etc.). Additional heating can cause high temperatures within the enclosure. The heater plate in the <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Pearl_Imaging_System.flsnp" /> imaging bed cannot cool the imaging bed if ambient temperature is above the set point for the imaging bed heater plate.</p>
        <p>Place the instrument away from sinks or other sources of water that pose a shock hazard. Recommended operating conditions are 15-35 °C and a dew point not greater than 22 °C to prevent condensation on the laser assemblies, which are cooled during operation.</p>
        <h2>Instrument Ventilation<a name="_bookmark3"></a></h2>
        <p>The air intake fan on the back of the <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Pearl_R_Imaging_System.flsnp" /> (<MadCap:xref href="External Panels and Controls.htm#rear" class="XreftoParanum">Figure 1&#8209;4</MadCap:xref>) is used to cool the internal electronics and maintain fresh air circulation throughout the internal volume of the instrument. Fresh air circulation prevents an internal buildup of anesthesia gas or oxygen. The air intake is filtered and the filter should be periodically cleaned (<MadCap:xref href="Routine Maintenance.htm#_bookmark24" class="H1PageRef"><b> <i> Routine Maintenance </i> <![CDATA[ ]]></b> on page&#160;1</MadCap:xref>). Make sure there is plenty of room behind the instrument (<MadCap:xref href="Imaging Drawer.htm#drawer" class="XreftoParanum">Figure 1&#8209;1</MadCap:xref>) so that the air intake is not blocked and the filter is easily accessible for cleaning.</p>
        <h2>Room Ventilation</h2>
        <p>A room with a minimum of 15 air changes per hour (non-recirculating) is required when using isoflurane anesthesia gas.</p>
        <h2>Space Requirements</h2>
        <p>The <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Pearl_Imaging_System.flsnp" /> instrument requires an area approximately 41 cm W (16") x 41 cm D (16") x 66 cm H (26"). Depth with the imaging drawer open is 63.5 cm (25”).</p>
        <!-- <h2>Moving the Instrument</h2>
        <p>Be cautious when moving the instrument. Use a minimum of two people when moving the <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/LI_COR_R.flsnp" /> <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/Pearl_Imaging_System.flsnp" />, as it weighs about 25 kg (55 lbs). Lift under the metal enclosure on each side of the instrument, keeping it as near vertical as possible. Gently set the instrument at its new location.</p>
        <p>After the instrument has been moved, use the adjustment feet on the bottom of the instrument to approximately level the instrument. If the instrument leans too far forward and is not sufficiently level, the imaging drawer may scrape the table or lab bench in front of the instrument. Each of the four plastic feet on the bottom of the instrument case has a threaded metal insert that can be turned in either direction to adjust its height. The instrument should not rock back and forth after you finished.</p> -->
