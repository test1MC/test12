        <p>Image acquisition with the Pearl Imaging System is designed to be as easy as possible. Typical imaging operations, such as choosing filters, exposure settings, or imaging algorithms, are eliminated by Image Studio software. The software also delivers properly exposed images on the first attempt, without saturated or underexposed pixels. This simplification of the imaging procedure enables additional capabilities such as “one-button” image acquisition, in which images are automatically acquired each time the Pearl Imaging System imaging drawer is closed. Capture of a time series of images is also possible.</p>
        <p>Acquired images can be displayed singly, or side-by-side with other images for comparison. A movie can be created to sequentially play a set of images to more clearly visualize changes. <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Image Studio no TM.flsnp" /> can be used to normalize acquisitions so that the same intensity value is displayed with the same color or grayscale value on all normalized images.</p>
        <p>Regions of interest can be analyzed by using standard shape tools to identify both a background region and the region of interest. In addition, an Auto Shape tool automatically marks regions of interest and also provides a standard to which data can be normalized.</p>
        <p>After analysis, images can be cropped, printed, or exported in a variety of ways. The data are also available for export and further analysis.</p>
