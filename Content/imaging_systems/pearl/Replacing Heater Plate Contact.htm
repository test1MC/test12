        <h1 MadCap:autonum="Chapter 1: ">Replacing Heater Plate Contact Pins</h1>
        <p>Over time, the heater plate contact pins on the bottom of the imaging bed that mate with the imaging drawer (circled below) can become bent and may no longer function as intended. In this event, the temperature in <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Image_Studio_TM_Sfw.flsnp" /> will read “N/A” even if the imaging bed is properly installed. Replacement pins are available in the spare parts kit included with the imaging bed. To replace a pin, use a needle nose pliers to pull out the bent pin and replace with a new pin from the spare parts kit. Press the new pin in to its mount slowly and gently, using the eraser end of a pencil until the visible shoulder on the pin is flush with the receptacle. The pin will “snap” into place.</p>
