        <h1 MadCap:autonum="Chapter 1: ">Oxygen Safety Considerations</h1>
        <p>Oxygen gas is a colorless, odorless, oxidizing gas. If O<sub>2</sub> is used as a carrying gas for the anesthesia gas, the chief physical hazard associated with the release of oxygen is its oxidizing power, which can greatly accelerate the burning rate for combustible materials. Keep the room well ventilated with fresh air by observing the room ventilation recommendations above.</p>
