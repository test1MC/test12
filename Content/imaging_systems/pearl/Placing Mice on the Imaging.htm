        <h1 class="pgBrkBfr" MadCap:autonum="Chapter 1: "><a name="_bookmark21"></a>Placing Mice on the Imaging Bed</h1>
        <p>When using gas anesthesia, mice should be anesthetized in an induction chamber before placement on the <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Pearl_R_Imaging_System.flsnp" /> bed. Wait until the isoflurane gas is flowing and you are ready to acquire an image with <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Image_Studio_TM_Sfw.flsnp" /> before moving a mouse to the imaging bed.</p>
        <p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> Anesthesia gas will not flow to the nose cone unless the imaging bed is locked in place (see <MadCap:xref href="Imaging Drawer.htm" class="TOCPageNumber"><b><i>Imaging Drawer</i></b> on page&#160;1</MadCap:xref>). If the imaging bed is not locked in place the heater plate temperature will read “n/a” as described above.</p>
        <p>Retrieve a mouse from the induction chamber and remove any bedding material or debris on the mouse. Open the <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Pearl_Imager.flsnp" /> drawer, quickly remove the nose cone plug, and slide the muzzle of the animal into the nose cone.</p>

        <p>Place the mouse on its side, back, or belly, such that the tumor or organs of interest are oriented as close as possible to the upper surface of the mouse as it lays (see <MadCap:xref href="#Using" class="TOCPageNumber"><b><i>Using Restraints</i></b> on page&#160;1</MadCap:xref>). The nose cone plug can be stored in its storage hole next to the nose cone (<MadCap:xref href="Starting the Anesthesia Gas1.htm#start" class="XreftoParanum">Figure 1&#8209;1</MadCap:xref>). Once the mouse is in place, push the drawer button to close the drawer.</p>
        <p class="warning"><b>WARNING:</b> Observe the tail of the mouse before closing the imaging drawer and make certain the tail will not be pinched between the drawer and instrument housing when the drawer closes. The drawer is specially designed to stop if resistance due to human fingers is detected, but a more delicate mouse tail may not be detected.</p>
        <p class="warning_fr">AVERTISSEMENT:</p>
        <p class="warning_fr_body">Observez la queue de la souris avant fermeture le tiroir d'image. Assurez-vous la queue ne sera pas pincé entre le tiroir et le logement d'instrument quand le tiroir se ferme. Le tiroir est particulièrement conçu pour s'arrêter si la résistance due aux doigts humains est détectée, mais une queue plus sensible de souris ne peut être détectée.</p>
        <p>Image Studio software can now be used to generate images of the animal. After completing image acquisition, open the imaging drawer, remove the mouse, reinstall the nose cone plug, and return the mouse to a recovery chamber or cage.</p>
        <p>At the end of the imaging session, turn off the vaporizer using the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>
        <h2><a name="Using"></a>Using Restraints</h2>
        <p>Occasionally, you may need to move limbs or other body parts out of the way in order to get the best view of the region of interest. Stretchable neoprene restraints can be found in the imaging bed spare parts kit. These restraints can be secured using the anchor slots along the edge of the imaging bed (<MadCap:xref href="#slots" class="XreftoParanum">Figure 1&#8209;2</MadCap:xref>).</p>

                        <p class="figure" MadCap:autonum="Figure 1&#8209;2"><a name="slots"></a>. The slots along the edge of the imaging bed can used to secure neoprene restraints that hold the animal in position.</p>
                    </td>
                    <td style="vertical-align: top;padding-left: 2pt;padding-right: 2pt;">
                        <p class="figure" MadCap:autonum="Figure 1&#8209;3">. Neoprene restraints can be placed across the animal’s body or looped around limbs to position the animal for imaging a region of <a name="_bookmark22"></a>interest.</p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>Restraints can simply be placed across the animal, or a loop method can be employed to secure individual limbs. To use the loop method, start by making a loop at one end of the neoprene restraint and slip the loop through one of the o-rings included in the imaging bed spare parts kit. Slip the loop over the animal’s limb and slide the o-ring toward the limb until the loop tightens gently around the limb.</p>
        <p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> Take care to exert the minimum amount of force required to restrain the animal to avoid injury. Be careful not to overtighten restraints to avoid cutting off circulation.</p>
        <h2>Using a Mouse Blanket</h2>
        <p>The spare parts kit for the Pearl Imager contains a package of black mouse blankets that can be laid over any part of the mouse to mask it during imaging. For example, if you try to inject a probe in the tail vein and miss the vein, the tail will be very bright relative to the rest of the mouse when imaged. A better image will be produced if a mouse blanket is laid on top of the tail to cover the bright area before imaging.</p>
        <p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> The mouse blanket should always be placed with the shiny side up. Whenever possible use a restraint to hold the mouse blanket in place. Unrestrained, the mouse blanket can move, or even fall into the Pearl Imager when the imaging drawer opens and closes.</p>
