        <h2>Routine Maintenance</h2>
        <p>The <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Pearl_Imager.flsnp" /> requires only minimal maintenance. However, as with any equipment utilizing electrical voltages, there is a danger of fire or electrical shock if the equipment is not properly maintained. <b>Disconnect power before servicing.</b> LI&#8209;COR Biosciences recommends that you routinely inspect the system. The following are some general maintenance guidelines:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Clean the exterior case parts with warm water and a damp cloth. The imaging bed can be cleaned with 0.5% bleach solution, ethanol or isopropanol. <b>Do not let any strong solvents or reagents containing DMSO contact the imaging bed.</b></li>
            <li>Wipe all chemical spills from the case and imaging bed to prevent damage to the surface coating.</li>
            <li>Keep the imaging bed free of organic solvents and other combustibles. Dry thoroughly before use.</li>
            <li>Inspect all cables and power cords for evidence of fraying, exposed wire, or loose connections.</li>
        </ul>
