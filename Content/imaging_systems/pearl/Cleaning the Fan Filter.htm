        <h1 MadCap:autonum="Chapter 1: ">Cleaning the Fan Filter</h1>
        <p>The air intake fan on the back of the Pearl instrument is used to cool the internal electronics and maintain fresh air circulation throughout the internal volume of the instrument. Fresh air circulation prevents an internal buildup of anesthesia gas or oxygen. Periodically inspect the air intake filter (<MadCap:xref href="#foam" class="XreftoParanum">Figure 1&#8209;1</MadCap:xref>). Clean or replace the filter when it looks like dust is starting to block air flow. To test air flow, place a piece of standard printer paper over the filter while the instrument is running. Release the paper. If the paper falls away, rather than being held to the air intake by suction, the filter is significantly blocked.</p>
        <p>The back cover snaps off for access to the foam filter. The filter can generally be rinsed out, dried, and replaced if it is only clogged with dust.</p>
