        <h1 MadCap:autonum="Chapter 1: ">Stopping the Anesthesia Gas Flow</h1>
        <p>Anesthesia gas flow to the Pearl Imager can be deliberately stopped in one of three ways;</p>
        <ol class="paren">
            <li>Disconnecting the external supply from the Pearl instrument,</li>
            <li>Closing the adjustment valve on the rotameter,</li>
            <li>Removing the imaging bed or raising the imaging bed handle to the vertical position.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>In all cases, the external anesthesia system should be properly configured with a drain or relief</b> (such as an induction chamber) so as not to harm the user or anesthesia equipment with the buildup of pressure.</p>
