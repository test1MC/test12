        <p>The <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Pearl_Imaging_System.flsnp" /> offers <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/in_vivo.flsnp" /> imaging in the near-infrared (NIR) where tissue autofluorescence and light scattering are low (<MadCap:xref href="#molar" class="XreftoParanum">Figure 1&#8209;1</MadCap:xref>). Because of the lower tissue absorption coefficient in the NIR region (700-900 nm), light can penetrate to depths of several centimeters.</p>

        <p>By contrast, tissue penetration depths are only a few millimeters in the visible region of the spectrum where autofluorescence and light scattering are comparatively high. Above 900 nm, water absorption can interfere with signal-to-background ratio. <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/LI-COR_R.flsnp" /> <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/IRDye_R.flsnp" /> 680RD and IRDye 800CW (particularly IRDye 800CW) are not hindered by interfering autofluorescence and yield high signal-to-background, making them ideally suited for optical imaging in small animals. A review of the development of fluorochrome-labeled optical agents (Kovar, Simpson, Schutz-Geschwender, and Olive, 2007) is included with this manual.</p>
