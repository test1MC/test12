        <p>The Pearl Docking Station requires only minimal maintenance. <b>Disconnect power before servicing.</b> Clean the exterior case parts with cloth dampened with warm water. Do not submerge or power wash. Inspect all cables and power cords for evidence of fraying, exposed wire, or loose connections. Periodically inspect external tubing for cracking or damage that could cause leaks.</p>
