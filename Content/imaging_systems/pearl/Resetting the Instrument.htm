        <h1 MadCap:autonum="Chapter 1: ">Resetting the Instrument</h1>
        <p>In the event that the instrument becomes unresponsive, reset the instrument by holding down the front panel power button (<MadCap:xref href="External Panels and Controls.htm#front" class="XreftoParanum">Figure 1&#8209;1</MadCap:xref>) for at least 5 seconds until the instrument turns off. This procedure cuts power to the instrument and should only be used when communication cannot be re-established by any other means. The Pearl Imager should resume normal operation after the power button is pressed again to turn the instrument back on, though start up may take several minutes.</p>
