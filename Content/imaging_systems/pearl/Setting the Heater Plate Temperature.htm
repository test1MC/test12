        <h1 MadCap:autonum="Chapter 1: "><a name="_bookmark20"></a>Setting the Heater Plate Temperature</h1>
        <p>The heater plate in the imaging bed is controlled by <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Image_Studio_TM_Sfw.flsnp" />. The heater plate control is located in the instrument toolbar. Make sure the imaging bed is dry, if recently cleaned, then click On to turn the heater plate on. The temperature will be briefly displayed as “n/a” and then will change to the actual temperature as the temperature changes. If the temperature is continuously displayed as “n/a”, the imaging bed is not mounted correctly in the Pearl Imager. See <MadCap:xref href="Imaging Drawer.htm" class="H1PageRef"><b><i>Imaging Drawer</i></b> on page&#160;1</MadCap:xref> for instructions on locking the imaging bed in place.</p>
        <p>The temperature is usually set near the internal temperature of the mouse to minimize heat loss during anesthesia. The set point range is 32-42 °C, in increments of 1 °C. The temperature set point is changed by clicking and dragging the temperature slider. The heater plate generally reaches the set point temperature in approximately 2 minutes.</p>
