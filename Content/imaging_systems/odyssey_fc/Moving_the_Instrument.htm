        <h1>Moving the Instrument</h1>
        <p>Be cautious and use a minimum of two people, one on each side of the instrument, when moving the LI&#8209;COR<span style="font-size: 80%;vertical-align: super;">®</span> Odyssey Fc Imager, as it weighs about 27 kg (60 lbs). Each person should place one hand in the lower hand hold and the other at the top of the instrument to help stabilize it. Keep the instrument as near vertical as possible. Gently set the instrument at its new location.</p>
        <p>After the instrument has been moved, use the adjustment feet on the bottom of the instrument to approximately level the instrument. The instrument does not need to be level for operation, but if the instrument is not sufficiently level, liquid in the imaging tray may be uneven and pool in one of the corners or sides. Each of the four feet on the bottom of the instrument case is threaded and can be turned in either direction to adjust its height. The instrument should not rock back and forth after you are finished.</p>
