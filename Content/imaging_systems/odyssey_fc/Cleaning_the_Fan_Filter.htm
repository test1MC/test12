        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">CAUTION: </span>Remove the tray and its contents from the instrument prior to any maintenance that requires moving or tilting the instrument.  </p>
        <p>The air intake fan on the back of the <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Odyssey_Fc_Imager.flsnp" /> is used to cool the internal electronics. Periodically inspect the air intake filter (<MadCap:xref href="#FoamFanFilter-Fig3-1" class="XreftoParanum">Figure 1&#8209;1</MadCap:xref>). Clean or replace the filter when it looks like dust is starting to block air flow. To test air flow, place a piece of standard printer paper over the filter while the instrument is running. Release the paper. If the paper falls away, rather than being held to the air intake by suction, the filter is significantly blocked.</p>
        <p>The back cover snaps off for access to the foam filter. The filter can generally be rinsed out, dried, and replaced if it is only clogged with dust. </p>
        <p>The foam fan filter on the back of the <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Odyssey_Fc_Imager.flsnp" /> is accessible for cleaning by removing the snap-on back cover.</p>
