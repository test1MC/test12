        <p><b>CAUTION:</b> Remove the tray and its contents from the instrument prior to any maintenance that requires moving or tilting the instrument.</p>
        <ol class="paren">
            <li>If necessary, turn off the <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Odyssey_Fc_Imager.flsnp" /> by first disconnecting the instrument from <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Image Studio no TM.flsnp" /> and then briefly pressing the power button on the <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Odyssey_Fc_Imager.flsnp" /> front panel.</li>
            <li>
                <div class="rightHalf">

				<b>Disconnect the power cord from rear of the instrument.</b>
            </li>
            <li>Disconnect the Ethernet cable from rear of the instrument.</li>
            <li>To access the desiccant, use a Phillips screwdriver to loosen the 4 screws on the top panel of the instrument. (These screws are captive and cannot be removed from the panel.)
			</li>
            <li>The top panel should now be removable. If not, check to make sure all of the screws are fully loosened. Once they are, the top should easily lift off.</li>
            <li>The brass desiccant cap is now visible (<MadCap:xref href="#FcWithTopPanelRemoved-Fig3-3" class="XreftoParanum">Figure 1&#8209;2</MadCap:xref>). Remove the desiccant cap by turning it counter-clockwise. You can use a screwdriver placed in the slot of the top of the cap to aid in loosening the cap.</li>
            <li>Remove the desiccant cartridge and discard.</li>
            <li>Remove the new desiccant cartridge from the shipping bottle and place it into the cap. Ensure the hook and loop fasteners engage.</li>
            <li>Replace the brass cap and desiccant by turning clockwise back into the camera. Some resistance will be felt while turning as the o-ring is being engaged. When the cap abruptly stops turning, it is correctly installed. No need to tighten any further.<div class="rightHalf"><p class="img"><img src="../../Resources/Images/fig_3-3.png" alt="Dessicant Cap Odyssey Fc" /></p><p class="figure" MadCap:autonum="Figure 1&#8209;2"><a name="FcWithTopPanelRemoved-Fig3-3"></a>. Odyssey Fc Imager with top panel removed. Location of the brass desiccant cap is indicated.</p></div></li>
            <li>Replace the instrument top panel and tighten the 4 screws until they are snug – do not over-tighten them.</li>
            <li>Reconnect the power cord and Ethernet cable.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Depending on the state of the old desiccant, it may take up to a few hours before the instrument is ready to be used. The status can be viewed by powering on the <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Odyssey_R_Fc_Imager.flsnp" /> and then starting the <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Image_Studio_TM_Sfw.flsnp" />. Observe the <b>Status</b> on the acquisition tab in the main window. When the instrument is ready for use, the <b>Status</b> will be “Ready”.</p>
        <p><b>Note:</b> If an error message to replace the desiccant is displayed after replacing the desiccant, power off the Odyssey Fc Imager and wait an hour or two. After waiting for the air inside the camera to dry, power on the Odyssey Fc Imager, start the application software, and see if the <b>Status</b> changes to “Ready” with no further error messages. If only a warning message is displayed, rather than an error message, the instrument can be operated normally as long as the <b>Status</b> is “Ready”.</p>
