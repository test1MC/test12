        <p><span>7.2.</span><span> Upon written request of either party, the dispute will be referred for negotiation to representatives of the parties who have no direct operational responsibility for the matters involved in the dispute and who have authority to resolve the dispute. </span>
        </p>
        <p><span>7.3. </span><span>If these representatives have not agreed on a resolution of such dispute within ten (10) Business Days of its referral to them, the dispute shall be promptly submitted to a neutral adviser (the "Adviser") who shall be chosen from the list of arbitrators registered with the American Arbitration Association.&#160; For purposes of this Section, "Business Day" shall mean each weekday and the hours of such weekday in which Licensee is open for business.&#160; The Adviser shall, within fourteen (14) days of the submission, recommend, in writing, a procedure for resolving the dispute and shall specify in such writing whether such procedure shall be binding, non-binding or involve a combination of binding and non-binding procedures. </span>
        </p>
        <p><span>7.4.</span><span> If the parties do not mutually agree upon the process recommended b the Adviser within ten (10) Business Days of their receipt of the Adviser's written recommendation, they shall promptly convene a non-binding hearing (the "Mediation").&#160; The rules for Mediation will be established by the Adviser, after consultation with the parties. </span>
        </p>
        <p><span>7.5.</span><span> If the dispute cannot be resolved, either through the procedure recommended by the Adviser or through </span><span>the Mediation</span><span>, within such period as the Adviser shall deem reasonable, the Adviser shall, at the request of either party, certify to the parties that the matter is incapable of resolution. </span>
        </p>
        <p><span>7.6.</span><span> No litigation may be commenced concerning the dispute until the Adviser has certified in writing that the dispute is incapable of resolution, provided that any party may commence litigation: (a) on any date after which such litigation could be barred by an applicable statute of limitations; or (b) if litigation is otherwise necessary to prevent irreparable harm to the moving party.</span>
        </p>
        <p><span>7.7.</span><span> Each party shall bear its own expenses in connection with the alternative dispute resolution procedures set forth in this Section, except that the parties shall split equally the fees and expenses of the Adviser, including the costs associated with any Mediation, and the fees and expenses of any other person designated by the Adviser to assist the parties. </span>
        </p>
        <p><span>7.8.</span><span> All communications made in connection with the alternative dispute resolution procedure set forth in this Section shall be treated as communications for the purpose of settlement and as such shall be deemed to be confidential and inadmissible in any subsequent litigation by virtue of Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, as the same may be amended from time-to-time.</span>
