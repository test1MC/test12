        <h1 MadCap:autonum="Chapter 1: ">Image Acquisition With No Analysis</h1>
        <p>For this procedure, it is assumed that the instrument is turned on and that the Image Studio software is running and connected to the instrument.</p>
        <h2>Sample Insertion</h2>
        <ol class="paren">
            <li>Place a blot or gel up to 10 x 12 cm in an imaging tray (Chapter 2), observing the alignment marks in the corners of the tray.</li>
            <li>Press the Imaging Drawer open/close button to open the imaging drawer.</li>
            <li>Insert the imaging tray into the imaging drawer, by sliding it down between the guide pins (Chapter 2).</li>
            <li>Press the Imaging Drawer open/close button to close the imaging drawer.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Image Acquisition</h2>
        <ol class="paren">
            <li>If necessary, click the Acquire tab to display all the image acquisition functions. </li>
        </ol>
        <div>
            <p class="img">
                <img src="../../Resources/Images/ImageStudioCaptureTest-1271996.png" alt="Image Studio 4.0.20 Acquire Tab" class="width100pct" />
            </p>
            <p class="figure" MadCap:autonum="Figure 1&#8209;1">. Acquire tab.</p>
        </div>
        <p>In general, the Acquire tab is used by starting on the left, checking each of the settings and finally, clicking the Acquire Image button to start image acquisition.</p>
        <ol class="paren">
            <li>Make sure the Status area indicates “Ready”. A status of “Ready” indicates the Odyssey<span style="font-size: 80%;vertical-align: super;">®</span> Fc instrument is connected and communicating properly.</li>
            <li>Set the analysis type to “None”. See the Odyssey Fc Tutorial Manual to learn how to start one of the other analysis types (Western or MPX Western) available when the Western key is installed.</li>
            <li>Select 700 and 800 for a standard two-color infrared acquisition using both the 700 and 800 channels, or select only one of the two channels if only one IRDye<span style="font-size: 80%;vertical-align: super;">®</span> conjugate was used on the blot/gel. Select Chemi for chemiluminescent substrates, or select Chemi and 700 if a fluorescent marker was used on the chemiluminescent Western blot. For Coomassie gels, select the 700 channel to image the stain. To image DNA gels stained with ethidium bromide or a comparable stain, select 600.   </li>
            <li>For typical acquisitions, leave the exposure time set to the default value of 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Click (CAMERA PIC).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If the Odyssey<span style="font-size: 80%;vertical-align: super;">®</span> Fc Imager has just been turned on or has been idle for a long time, the message “Warming Up” may be displayed in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Status</span> area of the ribbon. Warm-up takes about two minutes, during which time the camera controls are disabled. The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Status</span> changes to “Ready” when warm-up is complete. During image acquisition, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Status</span> area shows which image is being acquired and the progress. To stop an acquisition before it is completed automatically, click (STOP BUTTON). This action deletes the image that was in progress.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span><b>:</b> A more comprehensive review of acquiring images as well as analysis functions can be found in the Image Studio software Help system. The Odyssey Fc Tutorial Manual demonstrates basic functions of the software. </p>
