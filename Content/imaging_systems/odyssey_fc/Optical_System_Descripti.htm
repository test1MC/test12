        <h1 MadCap:autonum="Chapter 1: ">Optical System Description</h1>
        <p>The Odyssey Fc Imager is designed to image Western blots, membranes, or gels using visible, near-infrared or chemiluminescent methods. Before image acquisition starts, the imaging tray containing a membrane or gel is placed in the Odyssey Fc imaging drawer and the drawer is closed. A safety interlock prevents operation of the laser illumination module while the imaging drawer is open. Image acquisition is started via <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Image_Studio_TM_Sfw.flsnp" />.</p>
        <p>The <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Odyssey_Fc_Imager.flsnp" /> has four detection channels: two are infrared channels with 685 and 785 nm lasers, one is a 600 nm channel with a light source for excitation, and the fourth is for detecting visible wavelength emissions from chemiluminescent substrates. The channels used during acquisition are chosen in Image Studio software.</p>
        <p>The <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Odyssey_Fc_Imager.flsnp" /> laser module contains a 685 nm and 785 nm laser. During image acquisition, each laser source is turned on, followed by image acquisition with the LI&#8209;COR<span style="font-size: 80%;vertical-align: super;">®</span> CCD camera. For infrared imaging, a typical image acquisition consists of images for two fluorescent probes in the 700 and 800 nm channels (assuming both channels are enabled). Image acquisitions from chemiluminescent substrates use just the chemiluminescence channel and imaging is done at visible wavelengths. Note, however, that fluorescent markers can be imaged separately in the 700 nm channel and combined with the image from the chemiluminescence channel. Coomassie stains can also be imaged in the 700 nm channel. DNA gels stained with ethidium bromide or other comparable stains (such as SYBR Safe) can be imaged in the 600 nm channel. </p>
        <p>The quality of images from the <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Odyssey_Fc_Imager.flsnp" /> is enhanced by a patented filtering system that dramatically reduces noise before detection by the CCD detector. Infrared signal detection has also been optimized for LI&#8209;COR<span style="font-size: 80%;vertical-align: super;">®</span> IRDye<span style="font-size: 80%;vertical-align: super;">®</span> near-infrared dyes, which eliminates the need for filter selection by the user before imaging. The unique imaging technology, FieldBrite<span style="line-height: 11pt;font-size: 7.2pt;vertical-align: super;">TM</span> XT, used in the Odyssey Fc Imager acquires images without saturated pixels on the first attempt with no user adjustments. More than six logs (22 bits) of dynamic range are available for each image.</p>
