        <h1>Ambient Laboratory Conditions</h1>
        <p>Place the Odyssey Fc Imager away from external heat sources (furnaces, windows, etc.). Additional heating can cause high temperatures within the enclosure. Place the instrument away from sinks or other sources of water that pose a shock hazard. Recommended operating conditions are 15-35°C and a dew point not greater than 22°C to prevent condensation on the laser assemblies, which are cooled during operation.</p>
