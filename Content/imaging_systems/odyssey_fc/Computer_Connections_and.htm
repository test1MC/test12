        <h1>Computer Connections and Networking</h1>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span>: Use only the supplied Cat. 5e RJ45 Ethernet cable to connect the Odyssey Fc Imager and computer. The Ethernet ports on the Odyssey Fc Imager are both Auto-MDIX, so a cross-over cable is not needed.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Image Studio software starts, it searches for and discovers any Odyssey Fc Imagers automatically. If only one instrument is found, Image Studio software establishes communication. If more than one instrument is found, the user is presented with a list of instruments and asked which to use.</p>
