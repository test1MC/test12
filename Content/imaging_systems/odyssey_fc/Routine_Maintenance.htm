        <h1 MadCap:autonum="Chapter 1: ">Routine Maintenance</h1>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">CAUTION:</span>  Remove the tray and its contents from the instrument prior to any maintenance that requires moving or tilting the instrument.  </p>
        <p>The <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Odyssey_Fc_Imager.flsnp" /> requires only minimal maintenance. However, as with any equipment utilizing electrical voltages, there is a danger of fire or electrical shock if the equipment is not properly maintained. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Disconnect power before servicing</span>. LI&#8209;COR Biosciences recommends that you routinely inspect the system. The following are some general maintenance guidelines:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Clean the exterior case parts with warm water and a damp cloth.</li>
            <li>Clean the imaging drawer with 100% methanol, then water.</li>
            <li>Clean the imaging tray by first removing the sample and then rinsing the tray with methanol followed by distilled water.  Wipe or air dry.</li>
            <li><b>CAUTION:</b> DO NOT use acetone to clean the imaging tray.</li>
            <li>Wipe all chemical spills from the case and imaging drawer to prevent damage to the surface coating.</li>
            <li>Keep the imaging bed free of organic solvents and other combustibles. Dry thoroughly before use.</li>
            <li>Inspect all cables and power cords for evidence of fraying, exposed wire, or loose connections.</li>
        </ul>
