        <p>The <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Odyssey_Fc_Imager.flsnp" /> Imaging Tray has four corner markers that delineate the edges of the Odyssey Fc imaging area. Membranes or gels up to 10 x 12 cm placed within these markers will be fully imaged. Membranes or gels can be placed anywhere within the imaging area to be scanned. 
			Membranes should be placed sample side up with the top toward the rear of the instrument. Similarly, gels are also placed with the top toward the rear of the instrument. 
			Tips for handling and imaging membranes and gels are given later in this chapter. Trays are disposable and may be reordered using P/N 926-40020 (5pk).</p>
        <p>The imaging tray is designed to contain the small volume of liquid needed to keep blots or gels moist. Do not fill the imaging tray and be careful not to add so much liquid that the sloshing action created by closing the drawer may result in a spill inside the instrument. </p>
        <p>The imaging tray is inserted in the imaging drawer by aligning the notches in the tray with the guide pins in the imaging drawer (<MadCap:xref href="#GuidePins-Fig2-7" class="XreftoParanum">Figure 1&#8209;2</MadCap:xref>), and lowering the tray into the drawer. Make sure the tray rests flat on the imaging drawer before pressing the open/close button to close the drawer.</p>
