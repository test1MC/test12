        <h1 MadCap:autonum="Chapter 1: ">Imaging Drawer Safety</h1>
        <p>Be careful not to get your fingers caught between the Odyssey<span style="font-size: 80%;vertical-align: super;">®</span> Fc Imager and the imaging drawer when the drawer closes. The drawer is specially designed to stop when a certain level of resistance is detected, so no harm should result, but the experience may be startling.</p>
        <p>During an unexpected power loss, the drawer button will not function. This may leave a sample inside the Odyssey Fc Imager, or it may result in the imaging drawer being left partially open or closed. If the power remains off, the drawer can be opened or closed by pulling or pushing on the drawer front. The imaging drawer should resume normal operation once power is restored.</p>
