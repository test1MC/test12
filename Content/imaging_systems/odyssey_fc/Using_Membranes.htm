        <h1 MadCap:autonum="Chapter 1: ">Using Membranes</h1>
        <p>For Western blotting methods, nitrocellulose or PVDF membranes may be used (see www.licor.com/bio for the latest membranes and kits that are optimal for infrared detection). Detailed blotting protocols can be found in the <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Odyssey_R_Fc_Imager.flsnp" /> Application Protocols Manual. There are some general tips, however, for using membranes.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">IMPORTANT:</span> Do not touch the membrane – handle only with a clean forceps. Lift the membrane only by the corners. Fingerprints, even from a glove, will show clearly when imaged.</li>
            <li>Protect the membrane from light until it has been imaged.</li>
            <li>Keep the membrane wet if it is to be stripped and re-used. This can easily be accomplished by wrapping the membrane in plastic wrap.</li>
            <li>For infrared Western blots, store dry or in PBS buffer at 4°C.</li>
            <li>Do not dry chemiluminescent membranes for imaging.</li>
            <li>Use clean containers to avoid cross-contamination and reduce background.</li>
            <li>Multiple membranes can be washed together, provided there is ample volume so each membrane moves freely.</li>
            <li>The NIR fluorescent signal on the membrane will remain stable for several months or longer on blots stored dry and protected from light and air.</li>
        </ul>
