        <h1 MadCap:autonum="Chapter 1: ">Resetting the Instrument</h1>
        <p>In the event that the instrument becomes unresponsive, reset the instrument by holding down the front panel power button (<MadCap:xref href="ExternalPanelsAndControls.htm#FrontPanelFeaturesFcImager-Fig2-1" class="XreftoParanum">Figure 1&#8209;1</MadCap:xref>) for at least 5 seconds until the instrument turns off. This procedure cuts power to the instrument and should only be used when communication cannot be re-established by any other means. The Odyssey Fc Imager should resume normal operation after the power button is pressed again to turn the instrument back on, though start-up may take several minutes.</p>
