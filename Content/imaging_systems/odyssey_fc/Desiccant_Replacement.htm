        <h1 MadCap:autonum="Chapter 1: ">Desiccant Replacement</h1>
        <p>The Odyssey Fc Imager has a cooled CCD camera that uses a desiccant to prevent water condensation on the internal cooled surfaces. Depending on the humidity of the environment, the desiccant in the camera may need to be replaced periodically. <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Image Studio no TM.flsnp" /> will issue a warning if the desiccant needs replacement. A warning notice will first be given that will provide at least a few weeks of normal operation.  If not replaced in a timely fashion, an error will be generated and the cooler will be disabled to prevent damage to the instrument. This will prevent any new image acquisitions. The desiccant is user-replaceable. Please contact LI&#8209;COR Biosciences for a desiccant replacement kit to perform this task.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Important:</span> Do not remove the new desiccant cartridge from the shipping bottle until ready for installation.</p>
