        <h2>Laser Safety</h2>
        <p>The Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) was established in October 1982, by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to protect the public health in the fields of medical devices and radiological health.</p>
        <p>Manufacturers of products subject to performance standards under the Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act of 1968 are required to furnish various reports to the CDRH.</p>
        <p>The <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Odyssey_Fc_Imager.flsnp" /> is certified as a Class I laser product. This means that hazardous laser radiation is not emitted outside the instrument. Radiation emitted inside the <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Odyssey_Fc_Imager.flsnp" /> is confined within protective housings and external covers. A series of safety interlocks ensures that the laser beam cannot escape during any phase of user operation.</p>
        <p>One laser emits at 785nm and the other one at 685-690nm. The 785nm laser has a peak power rating of 1.2 watt. The 685-690nm laser has a peak power rating of 0.5 watt. The lasers emit visible and invisible laser radiation - <span style="font-weight: bold;">direct exposure to either beam may cause eye damage</span>. Laser radiation from each laser uniformly illuminates the target area only, which is marked in the imaging tray (<MadCap:xref href="#label1" class="XreftoParanum">Figure 1&#8209;1</MadCap:xref>) that fits in the imaging drawer. There is no emission of laser radiation outside the instrument under normal conditions.</p>
        <p>The CDRH implemented regulations for laser products on August 1, 1976 (CDRH radiation performance standard 21, Code of Federal Regulations Chapter 1, Sub-chapter J). Compliance for products marketed in the United States is mandatory. This product complies with CDRH radiation performance standard 21 CFR Chapter 1, Sub-chapter J. Ce produit est conforme à la performance de rayonnement CDRH chapitre CFR norme 1 Sous-chapitre J. The label that must be attached to laser products marketed in the United States is <MadCap:xref href="#label1" class="XreftoParanum">Figure 1&#8209;1</MadCap:xref> and is located on the rear panel of the <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Odyssey_Fc_Imager.flsnp" /> (<MadCap:xref href="#label2" class="XreftoParanum">Figure 1&#8209;2</MadCap:xref>), indicating compliance with CDRH regulations.</p>
