        <h1 MadCap:autonum="Chapter 1: ">Using Gels</h1>
        <p>DNA gels that are stained with ethidium bromide or other comparable stains (such as SYBR<span style="font-size: 80%;vertical-align: super;">®</span> Safe) can be imaged in the 600 nm channel. A detailed technical note on imaging DNA gels can be found in the Odyssey Fc Imager Application Protocols manual. Coomassie-stained gels can also be imaged since Coomassie Blue dye can be seen clearly in the 700 nm channel, and faintly in the 800 nm channel. To image a gel, observe the following guidelines:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Thoroughly rinse the gel with destaining solution or water to remove dye particulates.</li>
            <li>When placing the gel in the imaging tray, place the top toward the back of the instrument.</li>
        </ul>
