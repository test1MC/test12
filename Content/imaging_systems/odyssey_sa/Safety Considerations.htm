        <h2>Laser Safety</h2>
        <p>The Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) was established in October, 1982, by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to protect the public health in the fields of medical devices and radiological health.</p>
        <p>Manufacturers of products subject to performance standards under the Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act of 1968 are required to furnish various reports to the CDRH.</p>
        <p>The Odyssey Sa Infrared Imaging System is certified as a Class I laser product, containing a Class IIIb laser. This means that hazardous laser radiation is not emitted outside the instrument. Radiation<a name="_bookmark1"></a> emitted inside the instrument is confined within protective housings and external covers. The laser beam cannot escape during any phase of user operation.</p>
        <p>The CDRH implemented regulations for laser products on August 1, 1976 (CDRH radiation performance standard 21, Code of Federal Regulations Chapter 1, Subchapter J). Compliance for products marketed in the United States is mandatory. The label that must be attached to laser products marketed in the United States is Figure 1-1 and is located on the rear panel of the Odyssey® Sa Imager, indicating compliance with CDRH regulations.</p>
        <p>CAUTION: Use of controls or adjustments or performance of procedures other than those specified herein may result in hazardous radiation exposure.</p>
        <p>The Odyssey Sa Infrared Imaging System contains two lasers: one emitting at 785 nm and one at 685 nm. The 685 nm laser emits visible laser radiation – direct exposure to either beam may cause eye damage. Laser radiation is emitted through apertures at the top of the microscope assembly, inside the instrument enclosure.</p>
        <h2>Safety Interlocks</h2>
        <p>There are no user serviceable parts inside the <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Odyssey_R_Sa_Imager.flsnp" /> and it is not recommended that users open the instrument enclosure.</p>
        <p>When the top panel of the instrument is opened, safety interlocks immediately turn off the lasers. Audible tones also sound when the top panel of the enclosure is opened and closed.</p>

Back panel label of the <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Odyssey_Sa_Imager.flsnp" /> showing the following: 1) Power requirements, 2) FCC and CDRH compliance notices, 3) Laser radiation exposure warning, and 4) Class 1 Laser Product classification.</p>
        <h3><a name="_bookmark2"></a>Chemical Safety</h3>
        <p>LI&#8209;COR Biosciences recommends that all biochemicals be handled carefully, and that safe laboratory procedures be followed at all times. Be aware of the hazards associated with any chemical before you begin work.</p>
        <p>The <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Odyssey_Sa_Imager.flsnp" /> should not be used with any radioactive materials.</p>
