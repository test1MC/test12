        <h1 MadCap:autonum="Chapter 1: "><a name="_bookmark25"></a>Initial Odyssey  Sa Setup</h1>
        <p>Chapter 1 describes placement of the Odyssey Sa Imager. The addition of the BioStack™ Plate Stacker adds some other requirements. Chapter 1 describes the additional space requirements and the weight of the combined systems. A sturdy surface is also a requirement. Both the Odyssey Sa Imager and the BioStack Plate Stacker must be level during operation. Any surface that is susceptible to movement during operation is not a good choice for the Odyssey Sa/BioStack combination.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Before starting installation, each leveling foot on the Odyssey Sa Imager should be turned out one turn.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note: The feet are normally turned all the way in for shipment. If necessary, turn any loose foot all the way in (finger tight) before turning it out one turn. Turning the feet out one turn will make it easier to level the instrument in later steps.</p>
