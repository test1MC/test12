        <h1 MadCap:autonum="Chapter 1: ">Scanning Gels in the Membrane Carrier</h1>
        <p>The Odyssey Sa Imager can also be used to document Coomassie- stained gels, provided the gels fit in the Odyssey Sa Membrane Carrier (10.5 x 6.5 cm maximum) and are thin enough (&lt; 2 mm) that the laser/microscope has enough focus offset to focus in the gel. Maximum focus offset is 3.95 mm and the focus offset for a given gel is 3.0 plus half the thickness of the gel. Scanning Coomassie-stained protein gels is described in the Western Blot Analysis protocol found in the Odyssey Sa Imager Application Protocols manual.</p>
        <p>Other protocols developed for the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System, such as In-Gel Westerns, may be adaptable to the Odyssey Sa Imager, though not currently supported. Factors limiting the adaptability of these protocols include the size of the gel or membrane versus the Odyssey Sa Membrane Carrier and the focus offset of the Odyssey Sa Imager (there may not be<a name="_bookmark17"></a>enough focus offset to focus in the center of some gels). If you would like to try to adapt one of these protocols, they can be found at <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/supportSiteLink.flsnp" /><a href="http://biosupport.licor.com/">.</a></p>
        <h2>Using the Bar Code Reader (Optional Accessory)</h2>
        <p>When a scan is started, the Odyssey Sa bar code reader automatically scans the side of the microplate for a bar code. If a compatible bar code is found, it is read and stored in memory. To be compatible, the characters used in the bar code must be acceptable as file name characters. These include numerals, upper- and lower-case alphabet, space, underscore, and period. The Image Studio software can include bar codes in scan names, report names, reports, and data files. Supported bar code symbologies are Code 39, Codabar, Code 128, and Code 93. Extended Code 39 is not supported. Do not use optional check characters in the bar codes.</p>

        <p class="figure" MadCap:autonum="Figure 1&#8209;1">. Place the bar code on the left side of the plate within the red area, making sure the bars extend above and below.</p>
        <p>The Odyssey Sa bar code reader scans the side of the plate next to column 1 (left side as you face the instrument). The area that will be read is a 60.3 mm wide strip centered on the edge of the microplate. The lines of the bar code must extend above and below this 5.0 mm high strip that is 6.4 mm from the bottom of the plate. The minimum bar code line width allowed is 0.177 mm.</p>
        <p>Low-profile plates that are at least 10 mm high may also be used. Place the bar code at the top edge of the plate within the red area.</p>

        </p>
        <p>For best results, it is recommended that the bar code is centered on the side of the plate and its dimensions are 51 mm wide by 9.5 mm high. There is a maximum number of characters for each of the supported bar code symbologies that will fit these dimensions and the minimum bar code line width of at least 0.177 mm.</p>

        <p>If a narrower bar code is used, the number of characters must also be reduced so that the minimum line width of the bar code is at least 0.177 mm.</p>
