        <h1>Placement in the Laboratory</h1>
        <p>The Odyssey Sa Imager weighs approximately 24 kg (53 lb). When combined with the BioTek® BioStack™ Automated Microplate Stacking System, the combined weight is about 32 kg (72 lb). The system should be placed on a level laboratory bench that is sufficiently sturdy to bear its weight.</p>
        <h2>Ambient Laboratory Conditions</h2>
        <p>Place the Odyssey Sa Imager away from external heat sources (furnaces, windows, etc.). Additional heating can cause high temperatures within the enclosure, resulting in instrument shut down.</p>
        <p>Place the instrument away from sinks or other sources of water that pose a shock hazard. Recommended operating conditions are 15-35°C and a dew point not greater than 19°C. Extended operation outside these conditions will cause damage to the instrument.</p>
        <h2><a name="_bookmark3"></a>Ventilation</h2>
        <p>The instrument enclosure and circuit boards are cooled with two internal fans. There are no restrictions regarding placement of the instrument with respect to the fan cover; the fan shrouds are not filtered (requires no service), and the cover serves only as an exhaust outlet.</p>
        <h2>Space Requirements</h2>
        <p>The <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Odyssey_Sa_Imager.flsnp" /> requires an area approximately <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Sa_dimensions.flsnp" />, and a vertical clearance of at least 37 cm (14"). When used with the BioTek® BioStack™ microplate stacking system, the area required is approximately 61 x 122 cm (24 x 48").</p>
        <h2>Removing the Laser/Microscope Assembly Shipping Lock</h2>
        <p>The laser/microscope assembly moves beneath the microplate when the Odyssey Sa Imager is scanning. It is important to lock this assembly in place during shipment to prevent any damage that may be caused if it should bump into other hardware inside the imager. Two screws make up the shipping lock that holds the laser/microsope assembly in place. These screws must be removed before operating the Odyssey Sa Imager or the instrument status light will illuminate red, indicating a malfunction. Please contact LI&#8209;COR Technical Support for help in removing these screws.</p>
        <!-- <h2>Moving the Odyssey Sa Imager</h2>
        <p>Be cautious when moving the instrument. Use a minimum of two people when moving the Odyssey Sa Imager, as it weighs about  24 kg (53 pounds). Lift under each side of the instrument, and keep the instrument level as it is moved. Gently set the Odyssey Sa Imager at its new position. If you intend to ship the instrument, contact <a name="_bookmark4"></a>LI&#8209;COR Technical Support for instructions on how to prepare the instrument for shipment.</p>
        <p>Each of the 4 legs on the bottom of the instrument case are threaded and can be turned in either direction to adjust its height. After moving the instrument, turn the feet all the way in and then back out one turn so that all the legs are the same height. Press downward on each of the four corners of the instrument to find out if the instrument rocks and whether all four legs contact the surface. Adjust any legs as necessary to prevent the instrument from rocking.</p> -->
