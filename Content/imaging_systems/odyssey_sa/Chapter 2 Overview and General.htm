        <h3>Power Button</h3>
        <p>Briefly press the power button on the front panel to start up or shut down the Odyssey® Sa instrument. An indicator light in the power button blinks during the start-up or shut-down procedure and is continuously on when the instrument is ready to operate.</p>
        <h3><a name="_bookmark7"></a>Using the Power Button to Reset the Odyssey Sa Imager</h3>
        <p>The power button has another function beyond turning the instrument on or off. In the event that the instrument becomes unresponsive, the instrument can be reset by pressing and holding in the power button for five seconds. This procedure cuts power to the instrument and internal computer, so it should only be used when communication cannot be established by any other means. Normal operation should resume after the power button is pressed again to turn the instrument back on, though start up may take several minutes.</p>
        <h3>Eject Button</h3>
        <p>Pressing the eject button extends or retracts the Odyssey Sa plate carrier. A protective door automatically opens and closes as the plate carrier extends or retracts. This door protects the user from exposure to laser radiation. Do not defeat the operation of this door.</p>
        <h3>Using the Eject Button to Reset Network Parameters</h3>
        <p>The eject button also has an alternate use. After pressing the power button, there is a brief period during the startup procedure when the green scanning status light blinks. While the scanning status light below the eject button is blinking, the network parameters can be reset to automatic IP addressing by pressing the eject button and holding it down. Make sure the eject button is depressed at the end of the four times that the scanning status light blinks.</p>
        <h3><a name="_bookmark8"></a>Indicator Lights</h3>
        <p>Scanning Status: During normal operation, the scanning status light illuminates green when there is a scan in progress and is off at all other times.</p>
        <p>Instrument Status: The instrument status light is normally off, but illuminates red when there is a malfunction in the instrument.</p>
        <p>Contact LI&#8209;COR Technical Support if the instrument status light turns on.</p>
