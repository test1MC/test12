        <h2>Routine Maintenance</h2>
        <p>The <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Odyssey_Sa_Imager.flsnp" /> requires only minimal maintenance. However, as with any equipment utilizing electrical voltages, there is a danger of fire or electrical shock if the equipment is not properly maintained.</p>
        <p>LI&#8209;COR Biosciences recommends that you routinely inspect the system and follow these general maintenance guidelines:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Wipe all chemical spills from the exterior of the case.</li>
            <li>Clean the exterior case parts with warm water and a damp cloth. The exterior case parts are resistant to chemical spills, but do not use scouring compounds, solvents such as acetone, benzene, carbon tetrachlorides, lacquer thinner, or alcohol to clean the case.</li>
            <li>Inspect all cables and power cords for evidence of fraying, exposed wire, or loose connections.</li>
        </ul>
