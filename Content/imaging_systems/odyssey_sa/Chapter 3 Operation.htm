        <h2>Selecting Microplates</h2>
        <p>Microplates must meet certain physical characteristics to be scanned by the <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Odyssey_Sa_Imager.flsnp" />. Proper selection of microplates significantly affects the results of your analysis as each plate has its own characteristics including well depth, plate autofluorescence, and well-to-well signal crossover. Some general considerations for microplate selection are provided below and some of the Odyssey Sa application protocols give more specific microplate recommendations.</p>
        <h3>Microplate Compatibility</h3>
        <p>The In-Cell Western™ Assay uses detection at the well surface with no liquid present. This results in minimal well-to-well signal spread, allowing the use of both clear as well as black-sided plates with optically clear bottoms. For assays that involve imaging of a liquid, plates that have black walls and clear bottoms should be used to avoid well-to-well signal spread. <b>Do not use plates with white walls since the autofluorescence from the white surface will create significant noise.</b></p>
        <p>The Odyssey Sa microplate carrier supports both normal height and deep-well microplates conforming to the following standards:</p>
        <p class="specs">ANSI/SBS 1-2004 Microplates - Footprint Dimensions </p>
        <p class="specs">ANSI/SBS 2-2004 Microplates - Height Dimensions</p>
        <p class="specs">ANSI/SBS 3-2004 Microplates - Bottom Outside Flange Dimensions</p>
        <p>ANSI/SBS 4-2004 Microplates - Well Positions </p>
        <p><b>Note:</b> The ANSI/SBS standards can be found on the Internet at<a href="http://www.sbsonline.org/"> http://www.sbsonline.org.</a></p>
        <p>The ANSI/SBS standards specify standard dimensions for plates, but some plates conforming to these dimensions may still not be compatible. Plates vary in the location and thickness of the well bottoms, which can result in the <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Odyssey_Sa_Imager.flsnp" /> not being able to focus in the correct position. Some plate materials are also not sufficiently transparent or may produce high background fluorescence. When choosing a brand of plate, test it to make sure you have sufficient fluorescent intensity from the samples and that the background fluorescence from the plate is low.</p>
        <p>The following plates are recommended by LI&#8209;COR Biosciences:<a name="_bookmark12"></a></p>

        <p>To be compatible with the Bio-Tek® Bio-Stack™ Microplate Stacking System, microplates should have standard dimensions:</p>
        <p class="specs">Width: 3.365" (85.47 mm) +/0.015" (0.38 mm) at the corners </p>
        <p class="specs">Length: 5.030" (127.76 mm) +/- 0.015" (0.38mm) at the corners </p>
        <p class="specs">Height: 0.565" (14.35 mm) +/- 0.010" (0.254 mm)</p>
        <p><b>Note:</b> The <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Odyssey_R_Sa_Imager.flsnp" /> does support deep-well microplates, but the Bio-Stack does not.</p>
        <h3>Determining Focus Offset</h3>
        <p>The Odyssey Sa Imager requires that microplates have a maximum of 4.0 mm distance from the base of the microplate to the target detection area of the plate. When using the plates specified above, the recommended starting point for the focus offset is 3.0 mm.</p>
        <p><a name="_bookmark13"></a>The optimal focus offset for these plates or other plates can be determined by scanning a plate containing experimental and control samples at 1.7, 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0 mm focus offsets. Use the same intensity settings for each scan. After reviewing the collected scans, use the focus offset with the highest signal-to-noise for experiments.</p>
