        <h2>BioStack X-Y Alignment</h2>
        <p>The BioStack Plate Stacker is now close to the final position, but some small movements will be needed in the X-Y dimensions to ensure that microplates are placed squarely on the plate carrier.</p>
        <ol class="paren" start="36">
            <li>With the leveling and alignment fixture still in the BioStack plate gripper, manually lower the plate gripper until it is just above the <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Odyssey_Sa_Imager.flsnp" /> plate carrier. (Make sure the BioStack stacker is off.)</li>
            <li>Observe the position of the fixture relative to the four alignment pins on the plate carrier. When the X-Y alignment is correct, the fixture will fit as shown below.</li>

                <img src="../../Resources/Images/fixture.png" class="width088pct" />
            </li>
            <li>If you observe that the fixture will contact one or more of the pins as it is lowered, carefully move the BioStack™ Plate Stacker in small increments until the fixture drops onto the surface of the plate carrier without hitting any of the pins and binding.</li>
            <li class="NoNum"><b>Important:</b> Move the BioStack Plate Stacker carefully and only in small increments. Excessive movement can stress the plate gripper assembly, potentially causing damage.</li>
            <li>Observe the bubble level on the fixture and make any necessary adjustments to level the BioStack Plate Stacker.</li>
            <li>Tighten the knob on both alignment pins. You may need to hold the threaded washer until the knob begins to tighten.</li>

            </li>
            <li>Manually raise the BioStack plate gripper and remove the leveling and alignment fixture. Use the fifth thumbscrew to secure the fixture to the BioStack stand for storage.</li>

            <li><a name="_bookmark32"></a>Press the eject button on the <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Odyssey_Sa_Imager.flsnp" /> to retract the plate carrier.</li>
            <li>Turn on the BioStack instrument and wait for it to initialize.</li>
