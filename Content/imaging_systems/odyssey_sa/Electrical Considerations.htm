        <h2>Electrical Considerations</h2>
        <h3>Power Cords</h3>
        <p>The Odyssey® Sa Imager is equipped with a 3-wire grounding-type plug. This plug will only fit into a grounding-type outlet. This is a necessary safety feature. If you are unable to insert the plug into the outlet, you will need to replace the outlet. Do not defeat the purpose of the grounding-type plug.</p>
        <p>Do not locate the Odyssey Sa Imager where the power cord will be walked on or exposed to water or chemical spills.</p>
        <p>The Odyssey Sa Imager draws a maximum of 2.25 amperes at 120V. If an extension cord is used, make sure the total of the ampere ratings on the instruments plugged into the extension cord does not exceed the extension cord ampere rating. Also make sure the total amperage of instruments plugged into the wall outlet does not exceed the amperage capacity for the outlet. In the U.S., this is usually 15 or 20 amperes.</p>
        <h3><a name="_bookmark5"></a>Fuse Replacement</h3>
        <p>There are no user serviceable fuses inside the Odyssey Sa Imager. If the instrument fails to power up, and you suspect that a fuse has blown, contact LI&#8209;COR Technical Support.</p>
