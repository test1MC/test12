        <h1>Image Name</h1>
        <p>The options in the File Name group allow you to specify a format for image names. The format of an image name is comprised of a prefix and a suffix, in the form <span class="code">Prefix-Suffix</span>.</p>
        <h2>Prefix</h2>
        <p>The <strong>Prefix</strong> option allows you to specify the beginning part of a file name for scanned images.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Date + Time:</strong> If Date + Time is selected, the first part of the image name will be the year (Y), month (M), day (D), and time (hour, minute, second) when the image was acquired.</p>
                <p>The date and time will appear with the format <span class="code">YYYY-MM-DD_hh.mm.ss</span> in the image name.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Text:</strong> If text is selected, you will be able to enter text in the text field. The text you enter will be used as the first part of the image name. The word <span class="code">Image</span> is the default text.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Suffix</h2>
        <p>If the <strong>Suffix</strong> option is selected, you can choose a starting number to be appended to the image name. The number you set will be incremented by one for each successive scan (unless you change the number again).</p>
        <h2>Example</h2>
        <p>If <strong>Text</strong> is selected in the <strong>Prefix</strong> section&#160;and <strong>Suffix</strong> is selected and set to <span class="code">2</span>, the first image acquired with these File Name settings will be <span class="code">Image-000002</span>.</p>
