        <h1>Safety Precautions</h1>
        <p>Before using your scanner, read the following safety guidelines carefully. The safety guidelines detail the proper operation of the scanner and its accessories to prevent injury to users or damage to equipment.</p>
        <h2>Safety Icons</h2>
        <table>
            <col />
            <col />
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td style="text-align: center;">
                        <img src="../../Resources/Images/Warn1.eps" />
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        <p>This icon indicates a hazardous situation which, if not avoided, could result in injury to users or damage to equipment.</p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td style="text-align: center;">
                        <img src="../../Resources/Images/Warn2.eps" />
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        <p>This icon indicates a hazardous situation which, if not avoided, could result in serious injury or death to users.</p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <h2>Power Supply</h2>
        <p class="front-matter-warning1">Use a power source with the power rating specified on the marking label on the scanner.</p>
        <p class="front-matter-warning1-warning2">Turn off the power to each device before connecting or disconnecting cables.</p>
        <p class="front-matter-warning1-warning2">Insert the plug completely into the outlet, as a loose connection may cause arcing and result in fire.</p>
        <p class="front-matter-warning1-warning2">Hold the plug or connector to disconnect cables. Pulling the cable may damage the wire and result in fire or electric shock.</p>
        <p class="front-matter-warning1">Do not locate the scanner where the power cord will be walked on or exposed to water or chemical spills.</p>
        <p class="front-matter-warning1">When the scanner is left unattended and unused for long periods of time, unplug it from the wall outlet.</p>
        <h2>Moving and Storing the Scanner</h2>
        <p class="front-matter-warning1">Always ensure the scanner is stored properly before shipping or moving it. Quick stops, excessive force, and uneven surfaces may cause the product to overturn when moving.</p>
        <p class="front-matter-warning1-warning2">Do not hit or drop the scanner.  The scanner may be damaged if it receives a strong jolt, which may result in fire or electric shock if the scanner is used without being repaired.</p>
        <p class="front-matter-warning1-warning2">Do not place the scanner on any slippery, slanted, or unstable surface. The product may slide or fall, causing serious injury to people as well as serious damage to the product.</p>
        <p class="front-matter-warning1-warning2">Do not use the scanner near water. To avoid the risk of electric shock and other hazards, never spill liquid of any kind on the scanner.</p>
        <p class="front-matter-warning1-warning2">Place the scanner away from heat sources, such as radiators, heat registers, stoves, amplifiers, or other products.</p>
        <p class="front-matter-warning1-warning2">Do not store the scanner where it might be exposed to direct sunlight.</p>
        <h2>Using the Scanner</h2>
        <p class="front-matter-warning1">Before using the scanner, ensure the glass surface is clear from obstacles.</p>
        <h2>Maintenance and Service</h2>
        <p class="front-matter-warning1">Before cleaning the scanner, turn off each device and unplug the power cable from the AC outlet.</p>
        <p class="front-matter-warning1">For repairs, consult qualified service personnel.</p>
        <p class="front-matter-warning1">When replacement parts are required, use replacement parts that are specified by the manufacturer or have the same characteristics as the original parts.</p>
        <p class="front-matter-warning1">Inspect the scanner before using it. In addition, perform a regular inspection at least once per year.</p>
        <h2>Blue LED</h2>
        <p class="front-matter-warning1">The blue LED in the scanner is classified as Risk Group 1 (RG1), indicating low risk from optical radiation. During normal operation, the light emitted from the blue LED will not endanger human eyes.</p>
        <p class="front-matter-warning1">To protect your eyes, do not stare directly at the light from the blue LED.</p>
        <p class="front-matter-warning1">When using the blue LED for gel excision or observation, protect your eyes from direct exposure to the blue light by using the Viewing shield that came with your scanner or other appropriate eye protection. For details on how to use the supplied Viewing shield, see <MadCap:xref href="excising_or_observing_gel.htm" class="H1PageRef"><b><i>Excising or Observing a Gel</i></b> on page&#160;1</MadCap:xref>.</p>
