        <h1>Light Up Button</h1>
        <p>The Light up button moves the blue-LED light to an assigned position and turns it on when excising or observing a gel directly on the scan bed.</p>

            <br />When clicking this button, the blue-LED will be moved to a pre-defined position and then will be lighted up.&#160; After the blue-LED is lighted&#160; up, a window pops up on the screen where a countdown clock (3 minutes) is displayed to show how much time left for you to make gel excising or observation directly on the scan bed. When done, click the Light off button to exit&#160; the window.</p>
        <p>Please take note that if you have clicked the Light up button and spent more&#160; than 3 minutes to excise or observe a gel on the scan bed, you will be prompted a reminding message, which shows you have to wait at least 2 minutes for cooldown of the scanner and a window with clock on the screen. Click the OK button to exit the message window.</p>

            <br />At this moment, the clock in the window&#160;&#160;&#160; will start to count down (2 minutes), displaying how much time you have to wait for using the scanner again. When the countdown is finished, the Light off button&#160;&#160; in the window will be activated. Click it to&#160; exit the window and then you will be able to start to use your scanner again.</p>
