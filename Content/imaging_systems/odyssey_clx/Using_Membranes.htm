        <h1 MadCap:autonum="Chapter 1: ">Using Membranes</h1>
        <p>For Western blotting methods, nitrocellulose or PVDF membranes may be used (see <span href="http://www.licor.com/bio" class="hyperLink">www.licor.com/bio</span> for the latest membranes and kits). Pure-cast nitrocellulose membranes are recommended for best performance. Detailed blotting protocols can be found in the <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/OdyClxAppProtocolman.flsnp" />. There are some general tips, however, for using membranes with the <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Odyssey_CLx_Imager.flsnp" />.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Do not touch the membrane – handle only with a clean, smooth-edged forceps. Lift the membrane only by the corners. Fingerprints, even from a glove, will show clearly when imaged.</li>
            <li>
                Use the silicone mat included to cover the membrane(s) before scanning. Use the 4" soft roller included to remove any air bubbles that may be present. These optional steps help keep the membrane flat against the scanning surface for optimum imaging.
            </li>
            <li>
                Protect the membrane from light until it has been scanned.
            </li>
            <li>
                Keep the membrane wet if it is to be stripped and re-used. For Western blots store dry or in PBS buffer at 4°C.
            </li>
            <li>Use clean containers to avoid cross-contamination and reduce background.</li>
            <li>Multiple membranes can be washed together, provided there is ample volume so each membrane moves freely.</li>
            <li>If the signal on the membrane is too strong, the saturated pixels will appear cyan (blue) in the image.  Re-scan at a lower intensity setting in Manual mode, or use the Auto mode.</li>
            <li>The fluorescent signal on a dried membrane will remain stable for several months or longer if protected from light.</li>
        </ul>
