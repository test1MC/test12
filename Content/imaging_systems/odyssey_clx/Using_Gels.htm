        <h1 MadCap:autonum="Chapter 1: ">Using Gels</h1>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">A protocol for <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/InGelWesterns.flsnp" /> is provided in the <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Odyssey_CLx_Imager_Rcopyright.flsnp" /> Application Protocols Manual. Coomassie-stained gels can also be scanned since Coomassie Blue dye can be seen clearly in the 700 nm channel, and faintly in the 800 nm channel (see the Western Blot Analysis protocol for details). Nucleic acids stained with Syto<span class="_Override" style="font-size: 80%;vertical-align: super;">®</span> 60 and separated in a gel can be imaged in the 700 nm channel (see the Syto 60 Staining of Nucleic Acids in Gels protocol for more information). To scan a gel, follow these procedures:</p>
        <ol class="paren">
            <li>Thoroughly rinse the gel with destaining solution or water to remove dye particulates. </li>
            <li>When placing the gel on the scanning surface, take care not to trap air bubbles underneath. Cover the gel with plastic wrap to prevent drying, if desired.</li>
            <li>Scan the gel in the 700 nm channel.</li>
            <li>Adjust the focus offset for the gel thickness. The correct focus offset is 1/2 the thickness of the gel; for a 1 mm gel, set the focus offset to 0.5 mm. The maximum offset is about 4 mm in the Odyssey CLx  Imaging system, allowing gels of up to 8 mm to be scanned.</li>
            <li>After removing the gel, clean the glass surface to remove any residual dye by following the instructions in the section <MadCap:xref href="Before_You_Begin.htm" class="H1PageRef"><b><i> Before You Begin... </i></b> on page&#160;1</MadCap:xref>.</li>
        </ol>
