        <p>The <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Ody_Clx_Inf_Img_sys.flsnp" /> weighs approximately 33 kg (72 lbs). The instrument should be placed on a laboratory bench that is sufficiently sturdy to bear its weight. The bench should also be able to bear the weight of the computer if the computer is to be installed beside the <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Odyssey_CLx.flsnp" /> instrument.</p>
