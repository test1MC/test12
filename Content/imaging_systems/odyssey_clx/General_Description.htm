        <h1>General Description of Scanning</h1>
        <p>Scans are initiated using the <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Image Studio no TM.flsnp" /> Acquire ribbon. On the Acquire ribbon the user chooses the settings for the scan as well as the area to scan. Scanning progresses first across the X-axis, and then moves incrementally along the Y-axis of the scanning surface after each X-axis pass.</p>
