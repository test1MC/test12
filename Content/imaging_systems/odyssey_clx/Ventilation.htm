        <h1>Instrument Ventilation</h1>
        <p>The instrument enclosure and circuit boards are cooled with multiple internal fans. The fan on the rear of the instrument serves as an exhaust port, so the fan shrouds are not filtered and the cover serves only as an exhaust outlet. There are no restrictions regarding placement of the instrument as spacers on the rear of the instrument ensure sufficient airflow for the exhaust port. However, it is important to not allow any objects (e.g., paper or a cover) to block airflow from the exhaust port while the instrument is on.</p>
