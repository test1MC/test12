        <h1 MadCap:autonum="Chapter 1: ">Moving the Odyssey CLx Imager</h1>
        <p>Always be sure to disconnect the power to the instrument before moving it as described in <MadCap:xref href="Disconnecting_the_Power.htm" class="H1PageRef"><b> <i> Disconnecting the Power </i><![CDATA[  ]]></b> on page&#160;1</MadCap:xref>. Be cautious and use a minimum of two people, one on each side of the instrument, when moving the <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Odyssey_CLx_Imager_Rcopyright.flsnp" />, as it weighs about 33 kg (72 lbs). Lift under the metal enclosure on each side of the unit, and keep the unit as near vertical as possible. Gently set the instrument at its new location.</p>
        <p>The instrument can be leveled after it is moved, if necessary. The instrument does not need to be level for proper operation, but if the instrument is not sufficiently level, moistened membranes could slide on the scanning surface. </p>
        <p>Each of the 4 plastic feet on the bottom of the instrument case has a threaded metal insert that can be turned in either direction to adjust its height. Adjust the feet as necessary, until the instrument is level. The instrument should not rock back and forth after you are finished.</p>
