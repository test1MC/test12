        <p>Place the <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Odyssey_CLx_Imager.flsnp" /> away from external heat sources (furnaces, windows, etc.). Additional heating can cause high temperatures within the enclosure. Place the instrument away from sinks or other sources of water that pose a shock hazard. Recommended operating conditions are 15-35°C and a dew point not greater than 20°C to prevent condensation on the laser/microscope assembly during operation. Allow the instrument to adjust to the temperature and humidity of the room before powering it on to avoid damaging the instrument. It may be necessary to allow up to a day in the new location in cases of extreme temperature and/or humidity change.</p>
