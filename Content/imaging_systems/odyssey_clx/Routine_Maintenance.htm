        <h1 MadCap:autonum="Chapter 1: ">Routine Maintenance</h1>
        <p>The <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Odyssey_CLx_Imager.flsnp" /> requires only minimal maintenance. However, as with any equipment utilizing electrical voltages, there is a danger of fire or electrical shock if the equipment is not properly maintained. </p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/LI-COR_noR_Biosciences.flsnp" /> recommends that you routinely inspect the system and the scanning surface. The following are some general maintenance guidelines:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Wipe all chemical spills from the case and/or scanning surface to prevent damage to the surface coating.</li>
            <li>
                Inspect all cables and power cords for evidence of fraying, exposed wire, or loose connections.
               </li>
            <li>Keep the scanning surface free of organic solvents and other combustibles.</li>
            <li>Clean the exterior case parts with warm water and a damp cloth. The exterior case parts are painted with a durable urethane coating that is resistant to chemical spills. Do not use scouring compounds or solvents (e.g., acetone, benzene, carbon tetrachlorides, lacquer thinner, or alcohol) to clean the case.</li>
        </ul>
