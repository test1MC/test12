        <p>Membranes are placed on the scanning surface with the sample surface down and the top of the membrane facing the front of the instrument, as shown in <MadCap:xref href="#Fig3-2_MembranesAndGelsArePlaced" class="XreftoParanum">Figure 1&#8209;1</MadCap:xref>. Gels are placed in the same orientation.</p>
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> Handle membranes only with a clean, smooth-edged forceps and touch only the corners. Fingerprints, even from a glove, will show clearly when imaged.</p>
        <p>It is a good practice to leave a gap (1 cm or so) between the sample and either axis. This makes it possible to specify a scan boundary that is 1 cm larger than the membrane in all dimensions. The larger scan boundary creates an image that is easier to analyze in the <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Image_Studio_TM_Sfw.flsnp" />. If the sample is placed too near either axis or if the scan boundary is too close to the membrane, annotations in the Image Studio software may be truncated in some views. Multiple membranes and/or gels can be scanned at one time by simply drawing multiple scanning areas on the scanning bed graphic in the Acquire ribbon. </p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> The orientation of the samples on the scanning surface is not critical, but membranes are easier to analyze if the sides are parallel to the X/Y scan axes.</p>
