        <p>The following procedure is recommended before every scan: </p>
        <ol class="paren">
            <li>Thoroughly clean the glass scanning surface with ultrapure water and wipe with a lint-free tissue.</li>
            <li>Repeat the wash with isopropanol to remove any visible smears. Use ethanol to remove any remaining residues. If dye contamination continues to be a problem, slightly wet a cloth with acetone and wipe the glass.</li>
            <li class="NoNum"><b>Important:</b> Do not allow the acetone to contact anything other than the glass. The paint can be damaged by acetone.</li>
            <li>If the silicone mat is used, rinse it under warm water. Gentle lab soap may be used, but the soap must be completely rinsed away before use. The silicone mat may also be rinsed with isopropanol if needed. Dry the silicone mat with a lint-free tissue.</li>
        </ol>
