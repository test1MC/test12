        <h1 MadCap:autonum="I. ">Data Loss from Scanning</h1>
        <p>In addition to the fact that film can only record data within a narrow linear range, further data loss can be caused by digitizing film on an office scanner. Gassman et. al. compared images acquired on a CCD with images acquired by scanning film, and the scanned image was found to have a 2.6 times lower dynamic range <MadCap:xref href="../Normalization/references.html#Quantify" class="inline">(<span style="color: #63abdd;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>25</u></span>)</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p>Data loss caused by scanning can lead to inaccurate quantification and normalization.</p>
