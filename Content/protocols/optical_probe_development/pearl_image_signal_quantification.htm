        <h1>Signal Quantification</h1>
        <p>A standard set of image analysis tools is available in Image Studio, and the Small Animal Image Analysis key can be installed to provide functionality specifically for analyzing animal images.</p>
        <ul>
        	<li><strong>Regions of interest:</strong> You can define regions of interest (ROI), i.e. areas of the image with signal to be quantified, using rectangles, ellipses, or a shape drawn freehand.</li>
        	<li><strong>Image editing:</strong> You can cut, crop, copy, paste, delete, duplicate, and rotate images, as you would expect from software named “Image Studio”.</li>
        	<li><strong>Small Animal Image (SAI) analysis:</strong> The SAI key significantly reduces analysis time by allowing you to define and quantify ROI quickly. After choosing a couple parameters and setting a background shape, you can click the center of an ROI and Image Studio will automatically draw a shape around the ROI.</li>
        </ul>
