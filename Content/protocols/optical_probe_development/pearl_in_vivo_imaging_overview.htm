        <h1>Pearl Trilogy Imaging</h1>
        <p>The Pearl Trilogy is designed for rapid and intuitive animal imaging. With the Image Studio Small Animal Image Analysis key, you have access to many tools that make image analysis simple and efficient.</p>
        <p>Generally, the animal imaging process takes place in three phases:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><p>Capture a baseline image of the animal prior to administering the labeled targeting agent.</p></li>
			<li><p>Administer the labeled targeting agent.</p></li>
			<li><p>Capture images at specific, predetermined time points.</p></li>
		</ol>
		<p>The following procedure highlights how to capture animal images using the Pearl Trilogy Small Animal Imaging System and Image Studio Software.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>Before animal preparation, turn on the Pearl Trilogy and launch Image Studio software. This will ensure the system will have time to complete the startup procedure before you are ready to image your animals.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>In Image Studio, set the following conditions appropriately for your experiment.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<p>Set a heater plate temperature to keep the animal warm while it is under anesthesia.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Select the active imaging channels.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Select a resolution (recommended 170 nm).</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Select single or time-series imaging.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Run the focus routine and select desired focus position.</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Prepare animals for imaging:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<p>Remove hair from the target region (shave or use depilatory ointment).</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Clean animal, removing urine, feces, and bedding.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Capture a background image of the imaging bed and clean any dye that may be left on the imaging bed.</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Ensure gas anesthesia is flowing from the vaporizer to the Pearl Trilogy and the induction chamber, which is associated with the vaporizer unit.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p class="warning">See local regulations and instructions on use.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Acquire images from animals as defined by the study protocol.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Be sure to include time 0 baseline images of mice for reference.</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
