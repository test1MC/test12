        <p>Fluorescently labeled targeting agents and optical imaging are effective for monitoring disease progression and evaluating treatment efficacy in animals. Near-infrared (NIR) labeled targeting agents are valuable for non-invasive and longitudinal studies of disease, including tumorigenesis and metastasis. Preclinical studies to examine therapeutic effects, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drug-target interactions are possible with proper NIR-labeled targeting agent development and characterization.</p>
