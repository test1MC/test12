        <h1>Treatment Consideration</h1>
        <p>Include positive and negative controls when possible to help define imaging results, as well as to confirm that the labeled targeting agent is specific to the intended region of interest, (e.g. tumor).</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>Negative controls might include labeled non-specific agents of similar molecular weight showing no specificity to the intended cell or receptor of interest, or a placebo (saline) control.</li>
        	<li>Positive controls to the cell or target-of-interest can act to confirm specificity, demonstrate localization, or competitively bind the labeled targeting agent in vivo.</li>
        </ul>
