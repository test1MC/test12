        <h1 MadCap:autonum="I. ">Label a Small Molecule</h1>
        <p>Small molecules are more challenging to label, primarily because complicated purification techniques are generally required, such as high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC), or other methods. Failure to sufficiently purify the labeled targeting agent from any free unconjugated dye will cause significant background issues. If background problems have you stymied, the experienced <a href="http://www.licor.com/customservices" title="Custom Services Contact Page" alt="Custom Services Contact Page">Custom Services</a> team at LI-COR can help.</p>
        <p>After purification, you must determine an appropriate dye-to-protein ratio and concentration before moving forward with characterization of the probe.</p>
