        <p>A variety of assays can be used to determine selectivity of your labeled targeting agent, including In-Cell Westerns and On-Cell Westerns.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The <strong>In-Cell Western</strong> is a microplate-based immunofluorescence assay used to detect proteins in permeabilized cells, i.e., a relevant cellular context.</li>
            <li><strong>On-Cell Westerns</strong> are a receptor-based binding assay and may include dose response and competitive binding evaluations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These high throughput methods (96- or 384-well microtiter plates) provide a quick and effective way to understand labeled targeting agent activity toward the intended target.</p>
        <p>The following section will provide a brief overview of the In-Cell Western and On-Cell Western.</p>
