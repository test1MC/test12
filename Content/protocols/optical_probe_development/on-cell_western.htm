        <h1 MadCap:autonum="I. ">On-Cell Western</h1>
        <p>The On-Cell Western assay is a Receptor-based binding assay, and may include dose response and competitive binding evaluations where relevant.</p>
        <p class="moreInfo">For the full procedure, see the <a href="https://licor.box.com/s/dnwusvsbycajtaa9kexbt8emxmnv78i8">On-Cell Western Protocol</a>.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Prepare cell culture in 96- or 384-well microtiter plate.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Prepare serial dilutions of the labeled targeting agent to identify the effective concentration for further in vitro assay analyses.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Apply chemical inhibitors, stimulants, or drugs to induce a detectable response.</p>
                <p>Be sure to include positive and negative controls to assess non-specific binding and/or background effects.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Prepare labeled targeting agent for incubation and detection of a cellular or receptor-based response, with or without unlabeled blocking agents or competitive agents. This process is conducted on live cells so it is important to maintain cell health during the procedures.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Rinse and fix cells. No permeabilization is necessary.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Normalization of cell number allows ratiometric analysis of signals. Be sure to use a complementary dye for normalization to be captured at a different wavelength from your labeled targeting agent. eg, IRDye 800CW-EGF (800nm) and Draq5 (700nm).</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Cell permeable dyes that stain DNA (Draq5)</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Cell membrane stains (NHS esters).</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Rinse.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Scan the plate on an Odyssey CLx and use Image Studio Software for analysis (see Analysis below).</p>
