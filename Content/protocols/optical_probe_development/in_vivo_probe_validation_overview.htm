        <p>The end goal of most research involving labeled targeting agents is to study a particular disease or cancer model in vivo. Understanding the biodistribution of a labeled targeting agent is critical for meaningful image interpretation and analysis. For these reasons, it is important to confirm that your labeled targeting agent is specific to the intended target in vivo before beginning your study. It is critical to confirm that the labeled targeting agent can still find the intended receptor, transporter, or surface molecule in a plate-based assay, and to evaluate how the agent will ultimately be affected in the whole animal where multiple biological systems are at work.</p>
        <p>This guide will describe how to get started with an in vivo targeting agent validation.</p>
