        <h1 MadCap:autonum="I. ">Introduction to Ex Vivo Imaging</h1>
        <p>Imaging organs and tissues with the Pearl Trilogy is intuitive and straightforward.</p>
        <p>Once a signal has been identified non-invasively, the next questions that need to be addressed include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Are there specific organs of retention?</li>
            <li>Are signals uniform or mottled within an organ?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.licor.com/bio/products/accessories/pearl/organ_tray/">Pearl Trilogy Organ Tray Base and Disposable Organ Trays</a> were designed specifically for excised organ and whole tissue evaluations after administration of labeled targeting agents.</p>
        <p>Illumination on the Pearl Trilogy imaging bed is even, ensuring that multiple organs can be imaged together under uniform light exposure. You can then make a rapid visual assessment for multiple organs from an individual animal or for a specific organ from multiple animals.</p>
        <p>After imaging, the Small Animal Image analysis key provides a fast, intuitive way to quantify signal.</p>
