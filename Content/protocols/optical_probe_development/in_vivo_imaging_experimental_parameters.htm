        <h1>Experimental Parameters</h1>
        <p>Other important parameters to consider include:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>The route of administration should be optimized for each probe with the intended use in mind. The most commonly used routes are intravenous and intraperitoneal, but other options may be used, such as topical, intradermal, or intrathecal.</li>
        	<li>The imaging time point must be chosen to achieve the best signal-to-noise ratio.</li>
        	<li>The animal must be positioned to give the best view of the region of interest.</li>
        	<li>Hair removal may be necessary in some cases.</li>
        </ul>
