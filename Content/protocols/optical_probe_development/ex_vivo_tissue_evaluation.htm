        <p>NIR-labeled targeting agents for both in vitro and in vivo use provide the researcher with the unique ability to delve deeper into the tissues, because with proper storage the NIR signal will remain for an extended period of time.</p>
        <p>Methods of tissue preservation include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Frozen embedding methods using Optimal Cutting Temperature compound, followed by storage at -80 °C in the dark.</li>
            <li>Paraffin-embedding methods with ambient storage in the dark.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Tissue sectioning and microscopy are effective for more granular identification of targeting agent locations within the organ. With appropriate microscopy equipment, users can assess NIR-labeled targeting agent location (e.g. membrane bound, intracellular, or interstitial.</p>
        <p>To learn more about NIR microscopy, view microscopy applications from LI-COR, add links to our documentation/website information. Especially where we list microscope packages (Olympus and Zeiss) for microscopy in the NIR channels.</p>
