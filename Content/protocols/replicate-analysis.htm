        <p>Replication is an important part of QWB analysis, and is used to confirm the validity of observed changes in protein levels. Biological and technical replicates are both important, but meet different needs (<MadCap:xref href="../revert-normalization-protocol/revert-references.htm#http://w2" class="inline_no_paren"><span style="color: #63abdd;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>2</u></span></MadCap:xref>, <MadCap:xref href="../revert-normalization-protocol/revert-references.htm#https://2" class="inline_no_paren"><span style="color: #63abdd;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>3</u></span></MadCap:xref>).</p>
        <ul style="list-style:none;">
            <li>
                <p><strong>Biological replicates:</strong> Parallel measurements of biologically distinct samples, used to control for biological variation and examine the generalizability of an experimental observation.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Technical replicates:</strong> Repeated measurements used to establish the variability of a protocol or assay, and determine if an experimental effect is large enough to be reliably distinguished from the assay noise.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Technical replication can be performed by testing the sample multiple times on the same gel or membrane (intra-assay variation) or by testing the sample multiple times in several Western blot experiments. This procedure describes the normalization and analysis of technical replicates that were tested multiple times on the same membrane.</p>
