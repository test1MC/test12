                <p>Use the normalized Target Protein values for relative comparison of samples.</p>
                <p>In the example above, Target Protein level is 14% lower in UV-treated samples than in untreated samples.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>% CV can be used to evaluate the robustness of QWB results, and determine if the magnitude of observed changes in Target Protein levels is large enough to be reliably distinguished from assay variability.</p>

                    <li style="border:none;">
                        <p>The percent coefficient of variation (% CV) describes the spread or variability of measured signals by  expressing the standard deviation (SD) as a percent of the average value (arithmetic mean). Because % CV is independent of the mean and has no unit of measure, it can be used to compare the variability of data sets and indicate the precision and repeatability of an assay.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li style="border:none;">
                                <p>A low % CV value indicates low signal variability and high measurement precision.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li style="border:none;">
                                <p>A larger % CV indicates greater variation in signal and reduced precision</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li style="border:none;">
                        <p>On a Western blot, a change in band intensity is meaningful only if its magnitude substantially exceeds the % CV.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>Generally speaking, the magnitude of the reported change should be at least 2X greater than the % CV.</p>
                                <p><strong>Example:</strong> To report a 20% difference between samples (0.8-fold or 1.2-fold change in band intensity), a CV of 10% or less would be recommended for replicate samples.</p>
                                <p>For a specific measurement, this threshold for the magnitude of change would correspond to the mean + 2 SD.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Faint bands or subtle changes in band intensity are more difficult to detect reliably. In these situations, QWB analysis requires more extensive replication and low % CV.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>This is a general guideline only. Replication needs and data interpretation are specific to your experiment, and you may wish to consult a statistician.</p>

                <p>Compare the % CV of Target Protein replicates before and after normalization.</p>
                <ol style="list-style:lower-alpha;">
                    <li style="border:none;">
                        <p>Normalization should not greatly increase the % CV of replicate samples.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li style="border:none;">
                        <p>The purpose of normalization is to reduce the variability between replicate samples by correcting for lane-to-lane variation. A large increase in % CV after normalization of replicates is a warning sign that the normalization method is not sufficiently robust, and may be a source of experimental error.</p>
