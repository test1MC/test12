        <p>In quantitative Western blotting (QWB), normalization mathematically corrects for unavoidable sample-to-sample and lane-to-lane variation by comparing the target protein to an internal loading control. The internal loading control is used as an indicator of sample protein loading, to correct for loading variation and confirm that observed changes represent actual differences between samples.</p>
