                    <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/revert_tps.flsnp" /> is used to assess sample protein loading in each lane as an internal loading control. After transfer and prior to immunodetection, the membrane is treated with this near-infrared fluorescent protein stain and imaged. Membrane staining can verify that sample protein was uniformly loaded across the gel, and assess the quality and consistency of protein transfer.</p>

                <p><strong>Odyssey Loading Indicator, 800 nm (LI-COR, P/N 926-20002)</strong>
                </p>
                <p>Odyssey Loading Indicator (OLI) is an external loading control that is added to your samples just before electrophoresis and is used to verify that a similar sample volume was loaded in each lane. Because it is an exogenous protein, it does not provide information about the amount of sample protein loaded or transferred.</p>
