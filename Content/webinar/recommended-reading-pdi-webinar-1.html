        <p>This JBC editorial describes the “three major gaps” identified in overall data reporting. Gaps include “the need for (i) more complete disclosure of experimental design and reporting of experimental uncertainty and reproducibility, (ii) improved statistical and graphical presentation of quantitative data, and (iii) revised guidelines for the presentation and quantitation of immuno (“Western”) blots."</p>

        <p>This detailed study examines the role of sample preparation, protocol implementation, detection scheme, and normalization approach in quantitative Western blot analysis. It describes diagnostic experiments for evaluation of accuracy and precision in the immunoblot analysis workflow, and shows how “pseudoquantitative” immunoblot data can over- or underestimate protein abundance.</p>

        <p>This review outlines important issues in quantitative analysis of protein abundance. It describes how attention to sample integrity, antibody specificity, linearity of the detection system, and acceptable loading controls can improve quantitative immunoblotting.</p>

        <p>This study examines the role of the internal loading control in Western blot normalization, and evaluates the impact of overloading on loading control performance. It reports that abundant controls such as GAPDH and β-actin do not accurately reflect differences in protein concentration, emphasizing the need for validation of each internal loading control. Total protein staining is recommended as an alternative.</p>

        <p>This study demonstrates differential expression of commonly used internal reference proteins (actin and tubulin), not only between tissue types but in different portions of the same tissue. Total protein analysis is explored as a more robust approach to Western blot normalization. </p>

        <p>This analysis explores the effects of Western blot normalization on the statistical properties of normalized data. Common strategies are evaluated, including normalization by fixed point (a single internal reference protein) and normalization by sum (aggregate measurement of data points, such as total protein staining). The effects of different strategies on the coefficient of variation (CV) and subsequent hypothesis testing are discussed.</p>
