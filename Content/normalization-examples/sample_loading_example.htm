        <h1 MadCap:autonum="I. ">Sample Loading</h1>
        <p>Inconsistent sample loading cannot be avoided entirely. However, variation can be identified by running replicate blots and/or lanes. Visual assessment of membranes is helpful in spotting variation, but appearances can be misleading. Quantification of bands should be used for more definitive answers. Normalization must be used to minimize the impact of variation.</p>
        <p>Inconsistent sample loading can affect data analysis, as seen in <MadCap:xref href="#spurious-sample-load-graph" class="figure-x">Figure 1</MadCap:xref>. In this experiment, phospho-ERK was detected in an A431 cell lysate. The sample was loaded in triplicate. To mimic variation in sample loading, material from lane 1 was allowed to leak into the adjacent sample lane. After electrophoresis and transfer, <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/revert_tps.flsnp" /> was used to visualize total sample protein on the blot, followed by NIR fluorescence immunoblotting to detect p-ERK. Sample leakage caused a large coefficient of variation (CV) in raw p-ERK signals in the replicate lanes. Data were then normalized to total protein staining, to correct for inconsistent sample loading. After normalization, the CV for p-ERK was reduced by 130%.</p>

            <figcaption MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Figure 1. &lt;/b&gt;"><strong><a name="spurious-sample-load-graph"></a>Normalization can reduce the impact of sample loading variability.</strong> A) A431 cell lysate was loaded in triplicate. During gel loading, the sample in lane 1 was allowed to leak into lane 2 (indicated by white arrows), to mimic variation in sample loading. Prior to immunodetection of p-ERK (shown in green), <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/revert_tps.flsnp" /> was used to detect total sample protein on the membrane (shown in red). B) Sample leakage caused a large coefficient of variation (CV) in p-ERK signal when the replicate lanes were compared. After normalization to REVERT staining, the effect of sample leakage on CV was greatly reduced (CV for p-ERK signals decreased by 130%).</figcaption>
