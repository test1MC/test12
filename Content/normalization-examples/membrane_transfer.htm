        <h1 MadCap:autonum="I. ">Membrane Transfer</h1>
        <p>Replicates are also important for spotting variation that may be caused by transfer. The transfer process introduces many possible sources of variation:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Transfer stack position in the tank</li>
            <li>Loading position on the gel</li>
            <li>Inconsistent temperature across the membrane</li>
            <li>Inconsistent electric field across the membrane</li>
            <li>Improperly prepared transfer stack</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following example shows variation caused by an improperly prepared transfer stack. Although transfer variation can be spotted visually in this example, visual assessment can be misleading. Bands should be quantified for definitive answers.</p>

            <figcaption MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Figure 1. &lt;/b&gt;"><strong>Membrane transfer can introduce variability.</strong> Two gels were loaded with the same samples, and electrotransfer (semi-dry) was performed differently for each gel. The first stack was prepared carefully, according to standard procedure (A). The second stack was prepared indiscriminately (B). The blots were then treated identically with <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/revert_tps.flsnp" /> and imaged identically for comparison.</figcaption>

        <p>Further, total protein staining makes it possible to monitor transfer consistency across the entire blot at all molecular weights. This will help you spot any irregularities that might indicate the experiment should be repeated.</p>
