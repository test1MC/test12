        <p>Small sample-to-sample and lane-to-lane variations are inevitable. However, a well-designed protocol will reduce the impact of this inherent variation on your results. Examples in this section will show why the following points are important to consider when you plan an experiment.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Ensure even sample loading:</strong> Differences between protein abundance on a blot cannot be determined unless the same amount of sample protein is loaded in each lane. To ensure each sample begins with the same amount of protein, a protein concentration assay must be used to adjust sample concentration and make sample loading across your gel as consistent as possible.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Normalize:</strong> An accurate normalization strategy can correct for minor variation that occurs in spite of careful experimental technique. Your internal loading control and target must vary to the same degree with sample loading for normalization to be accurate.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Replicate, replicate, replicate:</strong> Even with consistent sample loading and accurate normalization, replication is still necessary. Technical replicates will help you identify inaccuracies caused by processing variability.</p>
