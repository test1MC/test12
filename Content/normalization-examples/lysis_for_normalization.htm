        <p>In a 2015 paper, Janes assessed possible variability caused by RIPA lysis buffer.</p>
        <p>Out of a panel of 20 protein targets, Janes found that RIPA lysis buffer efficiently solubilized some proteins as expected, such as GAPDH, Hsp90, IkBa, and various kinases. The cytoskeletal proteins actin and FAK were also solubilized.</p>
        <p>However, other proteins, such as tubulin, lamin A, KRT5, and even the transcription factor GATA2 showed substantial losses into the insoluble fraction.</p>
        <p>Janes concludes:</p>
        <p class="citeQuoteBox">These results collectively showed that lysis buffer composition substantially affects the results of quantitative immunoblotting <MadCap:xref href="../Normalization/references.html#Janes" class="inline">(<span style="color: #63abdd;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>3</u></span>)</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p>Therefore, for accurate quantitation and normalization, it is critical to be aware of the possible effects lysis buffer might have on your experiment.</p>
