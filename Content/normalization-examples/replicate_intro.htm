        <p>Both biological and technical replicates are necessary for accurate and reliable results.</p>
        <ul class="no-bull">
            <li><strong>Biological replicate:</strong> parallel measurements of biologically distinct samples that capture random biological variation, which may itself be a subject of study or a source of noise <MadCap:xref href="../Normalization/references.html#Points" class="inline">(<span style="color: #63abdd;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>30</u></span>)</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li><strong>Technical replicate:</strong> repeated measurements of the same sample that represent independent measures of the random noise associated with protocols or equipment <MadCap:xref href="../Normalization/references.html#Points2" class="inline">(<span style="color: #63abdd;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>30</u></span>)</MadCap:xref>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition to replicate blots, replicate sample lanes should be included within a blot. Replicate sample lanes help you characterize intra-blot variability, to verify that observed changes in band intensity are above the error of measurement and background threshold.</p>
        <p>Technical replicates can expose some common sources of variation.</p>
