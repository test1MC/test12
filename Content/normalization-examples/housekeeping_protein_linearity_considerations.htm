        <h1 MadCap:autonum="I. ">Verify that HKP can be detected with linear range of target</h1>
        <p>Many target proteins are low-abundance compared with ubiquitous HKP and structural proteins <MadCap:xref href="../Normalization/references.html#Aldridge" class="inline">(<span style="color: #63abdd;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>11</u></span>)</MadCap:xref>. If your target is low-abundance but your HKP is highly abundant, the two proteins will produce bands with very different intensities.</p>
        <p>If the target bands are faint but the HKP bands are strong, it may be difficult to detect your HKP and target within the same linear range. Outside the linear range, the relationship between protein and measured signal is unknown. The target and ILC signal will not vary to the same degree with sample loading, so the Core Normalization Principle will not hold. Normalization accuracy could be affected.</p>
        <p>In addition, the strong HKP band may become saturated, which means it cannot be quantified or used for normalization.</p>
