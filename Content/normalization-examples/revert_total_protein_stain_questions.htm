            <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/revert_tps.flsnp" /> Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        <p class="readingList">Should I stain my Western blot membrane with <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/revert_tps.flsnp" /> before or after I dry the membrane?</p>
        <p>
          You can use <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/revert_tps.flsnp" /> on a membrane that was kept wet or dry following transfer. To use on a dry membrane, briefly wet the membrane in water prior to adding the Stain Solution. For PVDF membranes, rinse first in methanol, followed by water.</p>
        <p class="readingList">Can I reuse <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/revert_tps.flsnp" />?</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/revert_tps.flsnp" /> is intended for a single use and reusing the stain on additional membranes is not recommended. Reusing the stain will affect normalization accuracy.</p>
        <p class="readingList">Will <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/revert_tps.flsnp" /> work with the iBind?</p>
        <p>Yes, <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/revert_tps.flsnp" /> is compatible with the iBind and nitrocellulose membranes.</p>
        <p>If you use PVDF membranes, you may need to optimize your procedure to ensure a low membrane background. Increasing the time for your wash steps may lower the background.</p>
        <p class="readingList">Does <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/revert_tps.flsnp" /> interfere with antibody binding or the detection of my Western blot target?</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/revert_tps.flsnp" /> is compatible with all subsequent Western blot immunodetection procedures and does not interfere with antibody binding.</p>
        <p class="readingList">How sensitive is <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/revert_tps.flsnp" />?</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/revert_tps.flsnp" /> is intended for staining total protein in individual lanes and has a linear detection range of 1-60 µg when used with cell lysate. However, individual proteins are easily detectable at low nanogram amounts.</p>
        <p class="readingList">After staining my membrane with <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/revert_tps.flsnp" />, I am not seeing any band development.</p>
        <p>Here are some possible causes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Transfer was compromised. Check to see if your molecular weight ladders transferred.</li>
            <li>Membrane was not rinsed with water prior to staining.</li>
            <li>Methanol was not added to the Stain Solution.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="readingList">Do you have any tips for lowering membrane background after staining with REVERT<sup>™</sup> Total Protein Stain?</p>
        <p>Be sure to add 30 mL of methanol to the Stain Solution prior to use (as described in the protocol).</p>

        <p class="readingList">How should I store <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/revert_tps.flsnp" /> and what is the shelf life?</p>
        <p>We recommend storing <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/revert_tps.flsnp" /> at room temperature where it is stable for 6 months from the date of receipt.</p>
        <p class="readingList">Can I strip and reprobe Western blots stained with <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/revert_tps.flsnp" />?</p>
        <p>Yes, you can strip and reprobe the membrane for subsequent detection of another target in the 800 nm channel. However, stripping and reprobing introduces random variation into your experiment. Blots that have been stripped and reprobed should not be quantified. See <MadCap:xref href="stripping_and_reprobing.htm">"Stripping and Reprobing" on page&#160;1</MadCap:xref> for more information.</p>
        <p class="readingList">Can I use <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/revert_tps.flsnp" /> on a blot that was stripped?</p>
        <p>The signal will be weak, so we do not recommend using the <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/revert_tps.flsnp" /> signal to normalize the reprobed target.</p>
        <p class="readingList">Can I stain my blot with <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/revert_tps.flsnp" /> after blocking the membrane?</p>
        <p>No, <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/revert_tps.flsnp" /> will also stain blocking buffer proteins that bind to the membrane. This increases membrane background and significantly interferes with accurate detection.</p>
        <p class="readingList">Can <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/revert_tps.flsnp" /> be detected by other imagers?</p>
        <p>
          For the best results, use Odyssey Imaging Systems, which are designed for superior near-infrared detection. Other imagers capable of detecting signals in the 700 nm channel can also be used with the stain. Alternatively, white light imagers can detect <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/revert_tps.flsnp" />. However, the linear and dynamic range will be reduced.
