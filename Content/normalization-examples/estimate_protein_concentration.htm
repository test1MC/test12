        <h1 MadCap:autonum="I. ">Reduce Sample Loading Variability and Correct for Inevitable Variation</h1>
        <p>Small sample-to-sample and lane-to-lane variations are inevitable in Western blotting. A good experiment is designed to prevent variation and adequately correct for the inevitable variation that will occur. The following two factors are fundamental to the design of a rock solid Western blot experiment.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Minimize amount of correction needed</strong> Normalization must be designed into the experiment to correct for variability that cannot be eliminated.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Use normalization to correct for unavoidable variation</strong> Use a normalization method with appropriate ILC that can correct for variation at all stages of the Western blotting process. Choice of ILC affects how accurately you can correct for variability.</p>
