        <h1 MadCap:autonum="I. ">Stripping and Reprobing</h1>
        <p>Although stripping and reprobing is common, it’s also time-consuming and will introduce variability into your analysis and normalization procedure. To improve accuracy and precision, replicate blots can be performed, but two-color fluorescence is the most accurate alternative to stripping and reprobing.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>If stripping is incomplete, residual antibody will generate artifacts when the blot is reprobed.</strong> This is particularly problematic if the two proteins co-migrate. In addition, complete removal of bound antibodies may be difficult to achieve.</li>
            <li><strong>Stripping can damage or wash away target protein.</strong> It may also cause significant loss of sample proteins from the membrane, perhaps 25% or more of the target in a single stripping cycle (<MadCap:xref href="../Normalization/references.html#Gomes" class="inline_no_paren"><span style="color: #63abdd;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>4</u></span></MadCap:xref>, <MadCap:xref href="../Normalization/references.html#Riis" class="inline_no_paren"><span style="color: #63abdd;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>16</u></span></MadCap:xref>).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Outcomes from various stripping conditions were examined in a 2015 study, using immunoblots probed with p-ERK1/2 antibody and a GAPDH internal control <MadCap:xref href="../Normalization/references.html#Janes" class="inline">(<span style="color: #63abdd;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>3</u></span>)</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <ul class="no-bull">
            <li><strong>Low pH Glycine Buffer Solution:</strong> Low-pH glycine stripping was very ineffective, with considerable residual antibody staining for p-ERK1/2 and GAPDH.</li>
            <li><strong>Guanidinium stripping:</strong> Although more effective for removal of GAPDH antibody, a p-ERK1/2 artifact remained.</li>
            <li><strong>SDS stripping with β-mercaptoethanol:</strong> This removed the GAPDH and p-ERK1/2 antibodies, but caused substantial loss of total protein from the membrane.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Janes describes stripping and reprobing as a “quantitative trade-off between antibody removal and total protein loss” <MadCap:xref href="../Normalization/references.html#Janes" class="inline">(<span style="color: #63abdd;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>3</u></span>)</MadCap:xref>. Protein-specific factors such as membrane saturation, amino acid composition, and post-translational modification are other potential areas of concern.</li>
            <li>Multiplex fluorescent immunoblotting makes normalization with an internal control simpler, more convenient, and more accurate. The blot is incubated with primary antibodies raised in different hosts. Secondary antibodies labeled with spectrally-distinct fluorescent dyes are then used to simultaneously detect the internal control on the same blot and in the same lanes as the target protein (<MadCap:xref href="../Normalization/references.html#Quantita" class="inline_no_paren"><span style="color: #63abdd;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>26</u></span></MadCap:xref>, <MadCap:xref href="../Normalization/references.html#Quantita2" class="inline_no_paren"><span style="color: #63abdd;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>27</u></span></MadCap:xref>). Blots are digitally imaged to detect the stable fluorescent signals. Stripping is not required, co-migrating proteins can be detected, and antibody cross-reactivity is easily identified.</li>
        </ul>
