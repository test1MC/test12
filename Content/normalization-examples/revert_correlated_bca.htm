        <h1 MadCap:autonum="I. ">Total Protein Staining Is a Reliable Indicator of Sample Loading</h1>
        <p>Your ILC must provide a reliable readout of sample loading, or normalization will not be accurate. Total protein staining (TPS)&#160;of membranes is one type of ILC that can provide a robust, reliable readout of sample concentration. TPS is emerging as the new standard method for Western blot normalization <MadCap:xref href="../Normalization/references.html#Aldridge" class="inline">(<span style="color: #63abdd;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>11</u></span>)</MadCap:xref>. The <i>Journal of Biological Chemistry</i> explicitly recommends this method, stating in the "Instructions For Authors"&#160;that the journal would:</p>

        <p>After transfer, the membrane is treated with a total protein stain to assess actual sample loading across the blot. Because total protein staining uses the combined readout of many different sample proteins in each lane, error and variability are minimized. Total protein staining is also used to monitor and confirm protein transfer across the entire blot, at all molecular weights.</p>

            <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/revert_tps.flsnp" /> is a near-infrared fluorescent membrane stain that can be imaged at 700 nm with an Odyssey<sup>®</sup> imaging system. REVERT staining is used to normalize your target protein to the total amount of sample protein present in each lane. Fluorescent signal from stained membranes is proportional to the amount of total sample protein loaded (see <MadCap:xref href="#fig-revert-vs-bca" class="figure-x">Figure 1</MadCap:xref>).</p>

        <h2>REVERT Staining Is Highly Correlated with Sample Loading</h2>
        <p>
            <MadCap:xref href="#fig-revert-vs-bca" class="figure-x">Figure 1</MadCap:xref> demonstrates that REVERT staining is proportional to total sample protein. In this experiment, total protein concentration of samples was quantified by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay, and gels were loaded uniformly with equivalent amounts of sample protein. After electrophoresis and transfer, the membrane was stained with REVERT<sup>™</sup> Total Protein Stain. The relative difference between known load amount and stained protein signal was then compared to examine the correlation between REVERT staining and sample protein loading as determined by BCA.</p>

Three different amounts of lysate (3.2, 1.6, and 0.86 µg) were loaded for electrophoresis and transfer (four replicates per gel on duplicate gels; n=8 for each loading amount). After transfer to Odyssey nitrocellulose membranes, blots were stained with <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/revert_tps.flsnp" /> and imaged at 700nm (Odyssey CLx Imager) to measure total protein signals. BCA and REVERT staining results were then scaled (mean intensity for 3.2 µg sample = 1) to enable direct comparison of results.</figcaption>

        <h2>Total Protein Loading: An Emerging Alternative for Normalization</h2>
        <p>Recent studies point to total protein detection as the emerging “gold standard” for normalization of protein loading. In this method, the membrane is treated with a total protein stain to assess sample loading in each lane, prior to immunoblot analysis. Many reference points are combined, reducing the impact of biological variability on quantification.</p>
        <p>The <i>Journal of Biological Chemistry</i> now explicitly recommends normalization to total protein loading, stating that “we prefer that signal intensities are normalized to total protein by staining membranes with Coomassie Blue, Ponceau S, or other protein stains <MadCap:xref href="../Normalization/references.html#http://w6" class="inline">(<span style="color: #63abdd;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>1</u></span>)</MadCap:xref>.”</p>
        <p>Total protein loading is typically assessed by staining of the membrane after transfer (<MadCap:xref href="../Normalization/references.html#Gomes" class="inline_no_paren"><span style="color: #63abdd;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>4</u></span></MadCap:xref>, <MadCap:xref href="../Normalization/references.html#Aldridge" class="inline_no_paren"><span style="color: #63abdd;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>11</u></span></MadCap:xref>, <MadCap:xref href="../Normalization/references.html#Total2" class="inline_no_paren"><span style="color: #63abdd;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>31</u></span></MadCap:xref>, <MadCap:xref href="../Normalization/references.html#Reversib" class="inline_no_paren"><span style="color: #63abdd;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>32</u></span></MadCap:xref>). Staining must be compatible with downstream immunodetection and should not alter or damage sample proteins. Some total protein methods, such as the Stain-Free trihalo labeling technology, rely on covalent labeling of sample proteins for detection (<MadCap:xref href="../Normalization/references.html#Taylor" class="inline_no_paren"><span style="color: #63abdd;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>23</u></span></MadCap:xref>, <MadCap:xref href="../Normalization/references.html#A" class="inline_no_paren"><span style="color: #63abdd;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>33</u></span></MadCap:xref>, <MadCap:xref href="../Normalization/references.html#Gomes" class="inline_no_paren"><span style="color: #63abdd;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>4</u></span></MadCap:xref>). However, membrane staining may be a more versatile approach, because it requires minimal alteration of Western blot protocols and bypasses the concerns raised by irreversible covalent modification of sample proteins (<MadCap:xref href="../Normalization/references.html#Taylor" class="inline_no_paren"><span style="color: #63abdd;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>23</u></span></MadCap:xref>, <MadCap:xref href="../Normalization/references.html#A" class="inline_no_paren"><span style="color: #63abdd;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>33</u></span></MadCap:xref>, <MadCap:xref href="../Normalization/references.html#Gomes" class="inline_no_paren"><span style="color: #63abdd;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>4</u></span></MadCap:xref>).</p>
        <p>Recent studies indicate that one of the most common methods may sometimes be unreliable – and publication standards are becoming more stringent. For these common HKPs, stable protein levels are generally assumed. However, an increasing number of gene expression and protein expression studies indicate that expression may be less stable than believed <MadCap:xref href="../Normalization/references.html#Li" class="inline">(<span style="color: #63abdd;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>10</u></span>)</MadCap:xref>.</p>
