        <p>Two blots were processed, one with methanol added to <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/revert_tps.flsnp" /> reagents (according to the protocol) and the other without methanol added to the REVERT&#160;reagents. After detection, the blot prepared with reagents that contained methanol was found to have a lower background.</p>
