        <h1 MadCap:autonum="I. ">Normalization Requirements</h1>
        <p>For a normalization strategy to be accurate, it must conform to the core principle of normalization. To ensure that your strategy is accurate, verify that your ILC meets these requirements:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>The ILC must be unaffected by experimental conditions.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The ILC and target must be detected within the same linear range.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The ILC must not interfere with target detection.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Choosing and validating an ILC that meets these requirements is fundamental to the design and accuracy of a quantitative Western blot.</p>
        <p class="moreInfo">The Normalization Handbook (<a href="http://www.licor.com/handbook">licor.com/handbook</a>) describes how to choose and validate an appropriate internal loading control.</p>
        <p>This guide focuses on examples of how normalization can go wrong, and provides tips for avoiding such problems.</p>
