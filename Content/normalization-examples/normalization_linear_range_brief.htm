                <p>Linear range</p>
                <p>The span of signal intensities that display a linear relationship between amount of protein on the membrane and signal intensity recorded by the detector.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>Outside the linear range of detection, the relationship between the amount of protein on the blot and the measured signal is unknown. Protein levels cannot be quantified outside the linear range, so you must ensure your ILC and target can both be detected within the same linear range.</p>
        <p>Linear range is an especially important consideration if you plan to use a housekeeping protein (HKP) for normalization. Many frequently studied target proteins are low-abundance compared to ubiquitous HKPs <MadCap:xref href="../Normalization/references.html#Aldridge" class="inline">(<span style="color: #63abdd;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>11</u></span>)</MadCap:xref>, making it difficult to detect the target and HKP in the same linear range.</p>
        <p>If your target is low abundance, it is likely that you will need to load a large amount of sample to detect it. However, loading a large amount of sample will cause a highly-abundant HKP&#160;band to produce a bright signal that is outside the linear range of the target. The HKP band may even reach saturation, meaning the signal is too bright to be recorded by the detection system and is unquantifiable. The HKP signal cannot be used for normalization if it is saturated or outside the linear range of the target.</p>
        <p class="moreInfo">See the Normalization Handbook (<a href="http://www.licor.com/handbook">licor.com/handbook</a>) to learn more about how to ensure your normalization strategy is not affected by the linear range of your system.</p>
