        <p>Normalization relies on an ILC to minimize the impact of sample-to-sample variation on your quantitative Western blot data. However, if your ILC is affected by the experimental conditions, it can actually introduce variability. HKPs are widely used for Western blot normalization, and stable levels of these proteins are generally assumed. However, recent studies indicate that HKP levels may be less stable than previously believed <MadCap:xref href="../Normalization/references.html#Li" class="inline">(<span style="color: #63abdd;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>10</u></span>)</MadCap:xref>. Because HKP normalization is based on a single internal reference protein, unexpected or unnoticed changes in expression of this HKP alter the interpretation of the sample loading indicator. This source of error will affect quantitative analysis and limit your ability to detect actual changes in your samples.</p>
        <p class="moreInfo">The Normalization Handbook (<a href="http://www.licor.com/handbook">licor.com/handbook</a>) explains the HKP normalization strategy, and provides a procedure for validating a HKP for normalization.</p>
