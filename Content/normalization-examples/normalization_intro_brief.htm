        <p>In simple terms, normalization is a way to improve the quantitative accuracy of Western blot data by correcting for small lane-to-lane and sample-to-sample variation. Several normalization methods are available, but the goal of each is to correct for variability inherent to Western blotting. No single normalization method can correct for everything. However, when used properly, normalization can minimize many common sources of variation, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Uneven sample loading</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Load volume</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Irregularities across the blot due to problems such as inconsistent transfer, uneven blocking, or uneven antibody incubation</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
