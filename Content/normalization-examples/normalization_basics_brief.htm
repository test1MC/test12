        <h1 MadCap:autonum="I. ">Normalization Basics</h1>
        <p>Normalization mathematically corrects for unavoidable sample-to-sample and lane-to-lane variation by comparing the target protein to an internal loading control.</p>
        <p>The target and internal loading control must be detected within the same linear range.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Internal loading control (ILC):</strong> Endogenous protein(s) that are unaffected by experimental conditions and used as an indicator of sample loading <MadCap:xref href="../Normalization/references.html#Aldridge" class="inline">(<span style="color: #63abdd;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>11</u></span>)</MadCap:xref>.</p>
                <p>Several types of ILC can be used, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>An unrelated internal reference protein, typically a housekeeping protein (HKP, such as actin, tubulin, or GAPDH) that is expressed in all samples at a stable, constant level.</li>
                    <li>Total protein staining of the membrane after transfer to visualize actual sample loading in each lane.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Linear range (LR):</strong> The span of signal intensities that display a linear relationship between amount of protein on the membrane and signal intensity recorded by the detector.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Accurate normalization requires that the target and internal loading control signals are both entirely dependent on sample loading.</p>
