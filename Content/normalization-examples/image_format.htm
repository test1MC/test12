        <p class="warning">Do not quantify lossy format images, such as JPEGs.</p>
        <p>Some image types undergo a software process known as “compression” when they are saved. This process makes the file size smaller, but it also results in irreversible data loss. To ensure you are analyzing the best available data, do not analyze lossy images, such as JPEGs. </p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/Image Studio no TM.flsnp" /> saves scans to 16 bit <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/TIFF.flsnp" /> images. Only the original 16 bit <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/TIFF.flsnp" /> files should be used for analysis. If you need to move Image Studio images between computers, use the export <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/ZipFilE.flsnp" /> option (see licor.com/getaredirecttothehelp.com for more information).</p>
