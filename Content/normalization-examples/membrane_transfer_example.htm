        <h1 MadCap:autonum="I. ">Improper Transfer Stack Causes Variation</h1>
        <p>Two gels were loaded with the same samples, and electrotransfer (semi-dry) was performed differently for each gel.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>One transfer stack prepared carefully, according to standard procedure.</li>
          <li>The second stack was prepared indiscriminately.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Blots were then detected identically and compared.</p>

            An improperly created transfer stack can introduce variation.

        <p class="moreInfo">With a total protein stain, you will be able to monitor transfer across the entire blot at all molecular weights. This will help you determine if any processing irregularities occurred that might require you to run the blot again.</p>
