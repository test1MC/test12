        <p>The <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/revert_tps.flsnp" /> is a membrane stain used to normalize target protein to the total amount of sample protein per lane. <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/revert_tps.flsnp" /> fluoresces at 700 nm, and signal from REVERT staining is proportional to sample loading.</p>
        <p class="moreInfo">Please see <a href="www.licor.com/revert">licor.com/revert</a> for more information about <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/revert_tps.flsnp" />.</p>
        <p>With a total protein stain, you can monitor protein transfer across the entire blot at all molecular weights. This will allow you to determine if there are any irregularities that indicate you should run the blot again to get more robust results.</p>
