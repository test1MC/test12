        <h1 MadCap:autonum="I. ">Estimate Total Protein Concentration Before Loading Gel</h1>
        <p>Each lane must be uniformly loaded with an equivalent amount of total sample protein. A protein concentration assay must be used to adjust sample concentration and make sample loading as consistent as possible. The experiment in <MadCap:xref href="#fig-estimate-protein-conc" class="figure-x">Figure 1</MadCap:xref> shows the importance of estimating protein concentration.</p>
        <p>First, samples were adjusted for uniform loading based on either BCA measurements or the manufacturer's labeled concentration. <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/revert_tps.flsnp" /> was then used to compare the total sample protein between lanes.</p>
        <p>Total protein staining was very consistent for lysates loaded according to empirically-measured concentration, even though the samples were from very different sources:  A431 – Hu epidermis, Jurkat – Hu blood, HEK293 – Hu kidney, COS-7 – Monkey kidney, NIH/3T3 – Mouse fibroblast, HepG2 – Hu liver.</p>
        <p>In contrast, lysates loaded according to the labeled concentration showed considerable variation in total protein staining. This underscores the importance of empirically verifying protein concentration to ensure consistent sample loading.</p>

            <figcaption MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Figure 1. &lt;/b&gt;"><strong><a name="fig-estimate-protein-conc"></a>BCA can be used to adjust sample loading and improve consistency.</strong> A) Duplicate gels were loaded with 5µg of each lysate based on BCA determination.  Samples were electrophoresed, transferred to Odyssey nitrocellulose membranes, and stained with <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/revert_tps.flsnp" /> according to the standard one-color protocol (<a href="http://licor.com/revert">licor.com/revert</a>).  B) Total intensity was measured for each of the stained lysate samples. The percent CV for the commercial lysates was 28.1% for blot 1 and 28.0% for blot 2.             The percent CV for the BCA-determined lysates was 4.8% for blot 1 and 5.7% for blot 2.</figcaption>
