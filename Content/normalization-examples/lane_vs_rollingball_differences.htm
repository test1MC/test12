        <h1 MadCap:autonum="I. ">Differences between Rolling Ball and Lane</h1>
        <p>Image Studio Lane and ImageJ Rolling ball are different in two key ways.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Rolling ball requires a user to choose a radius that will be used for background subtraction. Lane does not require input to accurately subtract background.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Rolling ball can be used to subtract background from an entire image, which will modify the underlying image data. Lane background can only be applied to a lane, and the background subtraction process does not change the underlying image data.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Whether Rolling ball is applied to an entire image or a lane, an appropriate radius must be chosen for accurate results. The correct radius is dependent on many factors: image resolution, shape width, shape separation, and shape overlap. These factors are likely to vary throughout an image, so choosing a radius that allows for consistent, accurate background subtraction can be difficult.</p>
        <p>When deciding if Rolling ball is appropriate for your analysis, consider the description of Rolling ball from the ImageJ documentation:</p>
        <p class="citeQuoteBox">“Removes smooth continuous backgrounds from gels and other images” <MadCap:xref href="../Normalization/references.html#Subtract" class="inline">(<span style="color: #63abdd;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>28</u></span>)</MadCap:xref></p>
        <p>If the background does not appear smooth and continuous, another approach may be necessary for accurate quantification and normalization.</p>
