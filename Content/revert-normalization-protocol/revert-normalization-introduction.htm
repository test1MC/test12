        <h1 MadCap:autonum="I. ">Total Protein Staining as an Internal Loading Control</h1>
        <p>Total protein detection is becoming the “gold standard” for normalization of protein loading. After transfer, but prior to immunodetection, the membrane is treated with a total protein stain to assess actual sample loading across the blot. Because this internal loading control uses the combined signal from many different sample proteins in each lane, error and variability are minimized. This antibody-independent method corrects for variation in both sample protein loading and transfer efficiency, and monitors protein transfer across the blot at all molecular weights.</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/revert_tps.flsnp" /> is a near-infrared fluorescent membrane stain used for total protein detection and normalization. REVERT staining is imaged at 700 nm, and fluorescent signals are proportional to sample loading.</p>
        <p>This protocol describes how to use <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/revert_tps.flsnp" /> for Western blot normalization and quantitative analysis.</p>
