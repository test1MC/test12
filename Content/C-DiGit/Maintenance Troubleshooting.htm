        <h2>Maintenance</h2>
        <p>The C&#8209;DiGit Blot Scanner requires only minimal maintenance. However, as with any equipment utilizing electrical power, there is a danger of fire or electrical shock if the equipment is not properly maintained.</p>
        <p>Disconnect power before servicing. LI&#8209;COR Biosciences recommends that you routinely inspect the system. The following are some general maintenance guidelines:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Clean the exterior case parts with warm water and a damp cloth.</li>
            <li>Clean the scanning surface with 100% methanol, then water.</li>
            <li><b>CAUTION:</b> DO NOT use acetone to clean the imaging surface.</li>
            <li>Wipe all chemical spills from the case and scanning surface to prevent damage to the surface coating.</li>
            <li>Keep the scanning surface free of harsh solvents and and other combustibles. Dry thoroughly before use.</li>
            <li>Inspect all cables and power cords for evidence of fraying, exposed wire, or loose connections.</li>
            <li>Do not allow sample or sample covering to extend past the imaging surface. This can prevent the instrument from operating properly by allowing light to enter the scan area.</li>
        </ul>
