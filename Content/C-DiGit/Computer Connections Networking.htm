        <p>The C&#8209;DiGit Blot Scanner uses IPv4 and IPv6 Link-Local Addressing to automatically create an IP network without any user configuration or additional servers. If you are using Windows 7, 8 or 8.1 and you experience connection problems, be sure that IPv6 is enabled on the computer.</p>
        <p><b>Note:</b> Use only the supplied USB 2.0 Type A to Type B cable or Cat. 5E RJ45 Ethernet cable to connect the C&#8209;DiGit Blot Scanner and computer. The Ethernet port on the C&#8209;DiGit Blot Scanner is Auto-MDIX, so a crossover cable is not needed.</p>
        <p>When <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/Image_Studio_TM_Sfw.flsnp" /> starts, it searches for and discovers any</p>
        <p>C&#8209;DiGit Blot Scanners automatically. If only one instrument is found, Image Studio Application Software establishes communication.</p>
        <p>If more than one instrument is found, the user is presented with a list of instruments and asked which to use.</p>
        <p>Because the C&#8209;DiGit Blot Scanner is a networkable device, there are a variety of connection and/or networking options available. Some networking configurations may require assistance from your IT professional.</p>
        <p>In general, there are two basic cabling configurations outlined below: 1) computer is connected to C&#8209;DiGit directly via the USB cable included, or; 2) computer is connected to C&#8209;DiGit directly via the Ethernet cable included.</p>
