        <h2>Using Blocking Buffer</h2>
        <ol class="paren">
            <li>Can I use Odyssey® blocking buffer to block my blot?</li>
            <li class="NoNum">Yes. Use only for the blocking step and be aware that the sodium azide from the Odyssey blocking buffer may still be present on the membrane at the detection step and will bind to the HRP enzyme, resulting in reduced light production and less intense bands.</li>
            <li>Can I use milk-based blockers?</li>
            <li class="NoNum">Yes. Milk-based blockers can be used for chemiluminescent detection but should be avoided when detecting phosphoproteins or glycoproteins. Milk- based blockers may contain endogenous biotin and glycoproteins, resulting in higher background on the membrane.</li>
            <li><a name="_bookmark9"></a>Can I dilute the HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies in Odyssey® blocking buffer?</li>
            <li class="NoNum">No. Odyssey blocking buffer contains sodium azide as a preservative. Sodium azide binds irreversibly to the HRP enzyme, inhibiting the binding of the substrate and slowing the chemiluminescent reaction. This results in less light production that may affect the appearance of less intense bands or even the entire blot. For optimal results do not use any solutions containing sodium azide for chemiluminescent Western blotting (for either secondary or primary antibodies).</li>
            <li>What is the best blocker for chemiluminescent Western blots?</li>
            <li class="NoNum">It is best to try several blockers to find the one that gives the most satisfying data for each antigen and antibody pair. There is not an optimum blocker for all conditions.</li>
