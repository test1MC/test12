            <li>Click Add Rectangle to add a rectangle to the image or Add Ellipse to add an ellipse. Click in the center of a feature to place the rectangle or ellipse around it. After adding the desired shapes, click Select or press the Esc key on your keyboard to return the cursor to the selection tool.</li>
            <li>To move or resize a shape, select the shape by clicking on it once. Dotted lines indicate the shape is selected.<ul><ol class="let"><li>To move the shape, drag the four-pointed cursor within the selection shape.</li><li class="NoNum"><img src="../Resources/Images/4890_shape.png" class="width050pct" /></li><li>To resize the shape, hover over any corner or side of the shape. Drag the double-sided arrow to resize.</li><li class="NoNum"><b>Note:</b> To activate the double-sided arrow, the cursor must be on the selection tool (click Select in the Analysis group or press the Esc key on the keyboard).</li><li class="NoNum"><img src="../Resources/Images/4890_shape2.png" class="width050pct" /></li><li><a name="_bookmark43"></a>To view the shapes and labels on the image, enable the Shapes and Labels check boxes in the Show group. Disable the check marks to remove the shapes and labels from the image.</li><li>To edit the label, click the Shapes tab at the bottom of the screen to view the Shapes Table. Under the Name column, double-click on the cell for the selected shape and edit the text. Press Enter, and the new text will appear on the image. To change the location of the label, click the small arrow on the Show group to open the Image View Labels menu.</li></ol></ul></li>

        <p><b>Note:</b> You can also rotate shapes by selecting them, pressing the Ctrl key, and scrolling with the mouse, or by clicking the Rotate button in the Edit group of the Analysis tab.</p>
        <h2>Profiles Tab</h2>
        <ol class="paren">
            <li>After creating at least one shape on an image, select a shape with the selection arrow until it changes to a dashed line.</li>
            <li>On the right side of the screen, click the Profiles tab to view two graphs of the pixels within a selected shape. The top graph is a cross section of the pixel intensities from top to bottom. The bottom graph is a cross section of the pixel intensities from left to right.</li>

                <img src="../Resources/Images/shape2.png" class="width050pct" />

        </ol>
        <p><b>Note:</b> The small black marks (circled in red above) indicate the boundaries of the shape. Move the shape around the band so that the small black marks are close to the edges of the peak to capture the entire signal for that band.</p>
        <h2>Auto Adjust</h2>
        <p>The software moves selected shapes to fully enclose areas of fluorescence near the shapes.</p>
        <ol class="paren">
            <li>Drag a rectangle around the shapes to select them. Dotted lines indicate the shapes are selected.</li>
            <li>Click <b>Adjust</b> and the shapes will move slightly to better enclose nearby areas of fluorescence.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Subtract the Background</h2>
        <p>Subtract the background of the blot or gel from the shapes to obtain consistent data. The software will not calculate Signal for the shapes if a background method is not selected.</p>
