            <li>Can I wrap the blot in plastic wrap before imaging?</li>
            <li class="NoNum">As long as the plastic is clear, clean, and wrinkle free (the plastic wrap may cause unwanted background, especially if it is folded or handled roughly), the blot can be wrapped in plastic before imaging. Note that plastic wrap will cause unwanted background; we recommend using plastic wrap only if you must seal the membranes.</li>
            <li>Why are the bands on my blot so light?</li>
            <li class="NoNum">Use the Lookup Table (LUT) in Image Studio to adjust how data are mapped to the display pixels of your computer screen.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You can view the Image LUTs as either slider bars (the default view, below left) or as histograms overlaid with a curve (below right). To hide this view, click the double arrows in the top right corner.</p>

        <p>Overlaying the LUT histogram is a curve with three adjustable points (above right). Move the top Max Point to the left to map more of the higher intensity data to the brighter display pixels to make the bands appear brighter. Move the lower Min Point to the right to map the lower intensity data to the background color, creating a visually cleaner background. The middle point smoothly adjusts the mapping from linear to logarithmic. Changing to a more logarithmic mapping reduces the contrast between the lower and higher intensity data, so the appearance of less intense bands is improved while avoiding overly dark bands.</p>
        <p>To change the Image LUTs from histograms (Curves) to Brightness/Contrast sliders, and vice versa, click on the Curves tab in the Image LUTs to toggle between histograms and Brightness/Contrast.</p>
