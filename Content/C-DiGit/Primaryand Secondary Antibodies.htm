        <ol class="paren">
            <li>Why is the signal missing in the middle of the bands?</li>
            <li class="NoNum">Too much secondary antibody on the membrane results in consumption of all of the substrate in that area. Without substrate, there is no chemiluminescent signal and a blank spot appears in the center of the band. Try different dilutions of the primary and secondary antibodies to find what gives the best results, or try changing the substrate.</li>
            <li>Does it matter where I purchase the HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies?</li>
            <li class="NoNum">The reactivity of secondary antibodies ranges widely between vendors. The ratio of HRP enzyme to antibody varies as well, and may affect the detection of the target. If the secondary antibodies from one vendor are not working, trying antibodies from LI&#8209;COR or other vendors may be helpful. LI&#8209;COR offers the <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/WesternSure_R.flsnp" /> Goat anti-Mouse HRP secondary antibody under part number 926-80010, and the <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/WesternSure.flsnp" /> Goat anti-Rabbit HRP secondary antibody under part number 926-80011.</li>
            <li>Should the HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies be highly cross- adsorbed?</li>
            <li class="NoNum">Although highly cross-adsorbed antibodies are essential for two-channel, multiplex detection, it is not always necessary with chemiluminescent blotting for a single target.</li>
