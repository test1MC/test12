        <p>High background can be caused by a variety of sources, including washing methods, secondary antibody concentration, and substrate choice. Background can be reduced by altering these sources.</p>
        <h2>High Background Due to Substrate</h2>
        <p>Pools of excess substrate on the membrane can lead to areas of high background, as can adding more substrate to a membrane that has dried. Apply the substrate carefully and wick off any pools of substrate before imaging. Do not allow the membrane to dry.</p>

        <h2>High Background from Wrapping the Blot in Plastic Wrap</h2>
        <p>Blots can be imaged directly on the C&#8209;DiGit Blot Scanner without wrapping in plastic wrap. In general, the membrane should not dry out in the amount of time it takes to complete a scan. However, to maintain moisture on the membrane for an extended amount of time, you can place a clear, flat plastic covering on top of the chemiluminescent Western blot to keep the substrate in contact with the HRP enzyme and to prevent the blot from drying out. It will also minimize pooling of the substrate.</p>
        <p>Image the plastic covering by itself first to determine if it scatters light, causing high background. You may need to try several types of plastic coverings before finding the best one.</p>
        <p>Wrapping the blot in plastic wrap may cause unwanted background, especially if it is folded or handled roughly. When using plastic wrap it is important to avoid wrinkles, as they scatter light, resulting in high background. In addition, try to avoid leaving fingerprints from pressing on the blot.</p>

        <h2>Low Signal</h2>
        <p>The C&#8209;DiGit Blot Scanner should be set to High Sensitivity to generate the highest signal. Chemiluminescent substrates vary in quality and effectiveness, and using a substrate from a different source may improve signal. Varying the primary and secondary antibody dilutions may also affect the signal and background of a blot.</p>
