            <li>Which substrate should I use?</li>
            <li class="NoNum">There are a wide variety of chemiluminescent substrates for HRP detection. In general, substrates with a faster reaction rate tend to be more sensitive. The C&#8209;DiGit Blot Scanner is designed to work well with most substrates. LI&#8209;COR carries a line of chemiluminescent substrates that have been optimized to work with the C&#8209;DiGit Blot Scanner; two of these substrates are WesternSure ECL (p/n 926-80100) and WesternSure PREMIUM (p/n 926-95000).</li>
            <li>How do I apply the substrate?</li>
            <li class="NoNum">Make sure the substrate is at room temperature before use. Substrate should be applied by following the manufacturer’s suggested methods for the amount of substrate to use and the incubation time prior to imaging. The substrate can be directly added to the sample side of the membrane (either by pipetting the substrate on the sample surface, or by preincubating the membrane in the substrate), allowed to incubate, and scanned without having to wrap the membrane before scanning. Membranes can also be wrapped in a plastic covering prior to scanning.</li>
            <li>The membrane dried during imaging. Can I apply more substrate and image again?</li>
            <li class="NoNum"><b>No.</b> Applying more substrate to a dried blot will likely result in high background.</li>
            <li>How do I keep the membrane from drying out?</li>
            <li class="NoNum">In general, the membrane should not dry out in the amount of time it takes to complete a scan. However, to maintain moisture on the membrane for an extended amount of time, place a clear, flat plastic covering on top of the chemiluminescent Western blot to keep the substrate in contact with the HRP enzyme and to prevent the blot from drying out. Membranes can also be completely wrapped in plastic covering prior to scanning (see <MadCap:xref href="Scanning Membranes.htm" class="H1PageRef"><b><i>Scanning Membranes</i></b> on page&#160;1</MadCap:xref>). Make sure there is no plastic wrap extending out past the scanning surface and into the outer lid seal.</li>
