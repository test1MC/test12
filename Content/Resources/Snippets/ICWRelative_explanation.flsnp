        <p><span class="snippet-font">ICW Relative</span> — After background subtraction, all wells designated as Sample or 100% Standard in a channel are divided by the intensity value of the well with the highest response. This well is given a value of 1.0, and the relative intensity values of the other wells will generally be between 0.0 and 1.0.</p>
        <p class="note">Negative relative intensities indicate the original intensity value was lower than the average background when the background was subtracted. </p>
        <p>If a normalization channel is selected, the intensity value of each well in the other channel is divided by the relative intensity value of the corresponding well in the normalization channel. </p>
