        <h1 MadCap:autonum="I. ">Set the Lanes</h1>
        <p>Lanes are represented by vertical lines that transect bands in a lane.</p>
        <p class="note"><span class="snippet-font">Lanes</span> must be selected in the <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/ShowGroup.flsnp" /> of the <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/Western_Or_MPX.flsnp" /> <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/AnalysisTab.flsnp" /> for the lanes to be visible.</p>
        <p>The correct number of lanes must be designated in the <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/Lanes_group.flsnp" />. Lanes only need to be positioned close to the center of a band, because the lanes will be optimally positioned by the software during band finding.</p>
        <p>To adjust a lane's position:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Click the lane to select it (selected lanes are dashed lines).</li>
            <li>
                <p>Click and drag the anchor point (dashed square) at the top or bottom of the lane to move only the top or bottom end point of the lane.</p>
                <p>Hold <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/SHIFT.flsnp" /> while moving an anchor to shift the entire lane.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Click anywhere away from the lane to set it.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Repeat this procedure until you are satisfied that the lanes are positioned close to the center of the bands. Lanes will be positioned optimally during band finding.</p>
