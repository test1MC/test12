        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Acquire</span>: Obtaining an image, 
 by instrument or by importing an image file.</p>
        <p><b><MadCap:keyword term="Acquisition:Defined" />Acquisition</b>: Image and its Data Analysis.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Analysis Type</span>: Can include Westerns, 
 ICW, DNA Gels, and more. After specifying the Analysis type, the user 
 is presented with a predefined set of acquisition parameters and analysis.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Application Button<span style="font-weight: normal;">:</span> <span style="font-weight: normal;">The large button in the upper left 
 corner of the application window that contains a menu of operations that 
 in some applications are most usually found on the File menu.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Background Type</span>: Method of calculating 
 background</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Band</span>: A feature in a lane that 
 indicates detection of a protein or DNA.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Bands Table</span>: A tabular view 
 of values in the Band fields, both automatically and manually assigned.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Boundary</span>: Outline of lanes area. 
 To see the outline be sure that Boundary is checked in Show options.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Button</span>: A small icon that issues 
 a command when clicked.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Channel</span>: A description of the 
 method used to collect pixel values. The description is usually a single 
 word or number approximating either the emission and/or detection wavelengths 
 or the detection method.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Columns</span>: A set of values assigned 
 to each image or feature. For example, Image columns for each Image are 
 viewed in the Images Table. Some values are automatically assigned during 
 the acquisition process based on acquisition parameters, (Resolution, 
 offset, channels, date-time of acquisition, for the Image columns for 
 example.) Other columns are manually assigned..</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Comb</span>: An apparatus used to form 
 the wells in a gel. A setting for determining number of lanes in the Western 
 MPX Analysis.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ellipse</span>: An elliptical shape, 
 that can be quantified, drawn around some section of the image.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Export</span>: A command on the Application 
 menu as a way to copy or move images and data.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Feature</span>: A box, circle or other 
 shape drawn around some section of the image. This object is visible on 
 the Image View and can be quantified.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Filters</span>: Ways to restrict the 
 Image Table view when many images are loaded into Image Studio.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Group</span>: A group of related commands 
 in a Task Tab or ribbon (e.g., the Filter group in the Table tab).</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Image</span>: The viewable result of 
 the Acquire action. This also refers to the set of all individual channels 
 and all analysis and logs. An Image-ID, a unique number, is automatically 
 assigned to each image as the result of an acquisition.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Images Table</span>: A tabular view 
 of values in Image fields, both automatically and manually assigned.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Key Tip</span>: Letter(s) and numbers 
 for accessing commands using the keyboard. Pressing the ALT key activates 
 Key Tips.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lab Book Report</span>: A customized 
 report of selected images and table data. This report is found on the 
 Application menu's Print menu.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Lane<span style="font-weight: normal;">: 
 A group of bands visible in the image that have the same channel, sample, 
 primary, secondary, and tertiary (if defined) attributes. In a Western, 
 there is on lane per channel per well. In an MPX™ Western, there is one 
 lane per channel per MPX apparatus groove.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lanes Table</span>: A tabular view 
 of values in the Lane fields, both automatically and manually assigned.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">LUT</span>: &#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;">L</span>ook<span style="font-weight: bold;">u</span>p <span style="font-weight: bold;">T</span>able. 
 Used to transform the raw pixel data from an image channel into a grayscale 
 or color for display..</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Marker</span>: A mixture of labeled 
 proteins or DNA having defined size. Also known as Sizing Standards.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Marker Lane</span>: A lane that contains 
 a marker.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Profile</span>: Graphic display of 
 a band or lanes showing pixel location and intensity.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Quick Access Toolbar</span>: A group

 Toolbar, and a set of Task Tabs.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Shape</span>: This describes the geometry 
 of a feature. Examples are square, ellipse, polygon, auto, band.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Shapes Table</span>: A tabular view 
 of values in the Shapes fields, both automatically and manually assigned.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Task Tabs</span>: A tab located in 
 the Ribbon containing Groups. Command Tabs are always visible. The visibility 
 of Contextual Tabs is determined by the selection.</p>

        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tooltip</span>: Hover the mouse over 
 a button or control in a dialog to display a brief explanation of the 
 control.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Well</span>: A depression used to contain 
 a sample. In a Western or MPX Western, wells are created in the gel by 
 the comb. In a microplate, the wells are features of the plate.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Western</span>: Western Blot. A method 
 in molecular biology to detect a certain protein in a sample by using 
 antibody specific to that protein.</p>
