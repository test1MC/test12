        <p>
            <p>QWB is often used for relative analysis of protein phosphorylation and other post-translational modifications (PTMs). This method combines two primary antibodies raised in different hosts: a phospho-specific or other PTM-specific antibody, and a pan-specific antibody that recognizes the target protein regardless of its modification state. Fluorescently-labeled secondary antibodies are used to simultaneously detect and discriminate the two signals. Phospho-specific signals are then normalized against the total level of the target protein, using that protein as its own internal loading control for maximum accuracy.</p>
            <p>This multiplex fluorescent method is used to analyze changes in target protein phosphorylation, glycosylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, and other PTMs.</p>
