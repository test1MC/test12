        <p>Antibody selection and validation are critical for pan/phospho analysis and pan/PTM analysis of other modifications. Follow these important guidelines:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Pan- and modification-specific primary antibodies must be raised in different host species, so they can be discriminated by the secondary antibodies. For example, a rabbit polyclonal pan-antibody can be used with a mouse monoclonal phospho-antibody.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Use highly cross-adsorbed secondary antibodies labeled with spectrally distinct NIR fluorescent dyes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The primary antibodies must recognize different epitopes on the protein, to avoid binding interference. Polyclonal pan-specific antibodies less likely to demonstrate interference.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>To validate the primary antibody pair, three Western blots are recommended. Perform a separate Western blot with each individual primary antibody, and a third blot with the two primary antibodies combined. These controls will characterize the banding patterns and verify that the primary antibodies can be multiplexed.</p>

        </ul>
