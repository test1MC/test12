        <h1 MadCap:autonum="I. ">Introduction</h1>
        <p>In quantitative Western blotting (QWB), normalization mathematically corrects for unavoidable sample-to-sample and lane-to-lane variation by comparing the target protein to an internal loading control. The internal loading control is used as an indicator of sample protein loading, to correct for loading variation and confirm that changes observed in target protein bands represent actual differences between samples.</p>
        <p>QWB analysis is accurate only if the target protein and internal loading control can both be detected within the same linear range – a range that must be determined experimentally for each target and loading control. The combined linear range is then used to determine how much sample should be loaded to produce a linear signal response for both the target protein and the internal loading control (<MadCap:xref href="linear-range-saturation-proportionality.htm#linear-protocol-combined-LR-illustration" class="figure-x">Figure 1</MadCap:xref>).</p>
