Shaded regions indicate the range of sample loading that produces a linear signal response on each graph. Linear range boundaries may be very different for the target and HKP.

                <p>Combine the linear ranges of sample loading to identify the available range where the target and HKP can both be detected with a linear signal response (<MadCap:xref href="#linear-protocol-appropriate-LR-target-HKP" class="figure-x">Figure 2</MadCap:xref>). Use a secondary y-axis to plot the 700 nm and 800 nm signals on the same graph.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>For your experiments, choose a level of sample loading that falls in the middle of the combined linear range for the target protein and HKP (X, <MadCap:xref href="#linear-protocol-appropriate-LR-target-HKP" class="figure-x">Figure 2</MadCap:xref>). Avoid working near the boundaries of the combined range.</p>

                <p>If the target is low in abundance and the HKP is highly expressed, it may not be possible to identify a level of sample loading that is appropriate for both proteins. Consider using a total protein stain as an internal loading control for QWB normalization.</p>

            <p class="note">If the target protein is strongly upregulated or downregulated, you should examine the linear range of sample loading for both untreated and treated samples.</p>
