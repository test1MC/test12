                    <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/revert_tps.flsnp" /> is used to assess sample protein loading in each lane as an internal loading control. After transfer and prior to immunodetection, the membrane is treated with this near-infrared fluorescent protein stain and imaged at 700 nm. Membrane staining can verify that sample protein was uniformly loaded across the gel, and assess the quality and consistency of protein transfer.</p>
