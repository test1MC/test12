        <h1 class="pgBrkBfr" MadCap:autonum="I. ">Linear Range, Saturation, and Proportional Signals</h1>
        <p>In QWB analysis, the <strong>linear range of detection</strong> is the range of sample loading that produces a linear relationship between the amount of target on the membrane and the band intensity recorded by the detector (<MadCap:xref href="#linear-protocol-combined-LR-illustration" class="figure-x">Figure 1</MadCap:xref>). Outside this range, signal intensity is not dependent on sample loading and does not accurately reflect the amount of target.</p>
        <p>Within the linear range of detection, <strong>band intensity should be proportional to the amount of target</strong>. A change in target abundance should produce an equivalent change in signal response. For example, a two-fold increase in sample loading is expected to produce a two-fold increase in band intensity. At the upper and lower ends of the linear range, this proportional relationship is lost. Band intensity no longer reflects the abundance of target, and quantification is not possible.</p>

            <figcaption MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Figure 1. &lt;/b&gt;"><a name="linear-protocol-combined-LR-illustration"></a><strong>In the linear range of detection, the target and internal loading control both display a linear relationship between sample loading and band intensity.</strong> Determine the linear range separately for the target and internal loading control. Combine these ranges to identify a level of sample loading that will produce a linear response for both. Dotted lines indicate loss of proportionality on the upper and lower ends of the linear range.

        <p><strong>Saturation</strong> occurs when increasing amounts of target fail to produce the expected increase in band intensity. Saturated bands yield similar intensity values, regardless of the actual amount of target present, and cannot be accurately quantified. Intensity of strong bands is underestimated, interfering with comparison of relative protein levels across the blot. Error introduced by saturation may alter data analysis and interpretation.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Membrane saturation</strong> is the result of sample overloading. It frequently interferes with accurate detection of abundant proteins, including HKP loading controls. When samples are overloaded, abundant proteins can bind in layers on the membrane surface that limit antibody access during detection. Highly abundant proteins may also exceed the local binding capacity of the membrane and be washed away.</li>
            <li><strong>Signal saturation</strong> occurs when the signal intensity of a band is too bright for the detection system to record. Increasing amounts of target do not produce a proportional increase in the recorded signal.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This protocol explains how to use serial dilutions of sample protein to determine the linear ranges of detection for a target and internal loading control, and choose an appropriate amount of sample to load for QWB analysis.</p>
