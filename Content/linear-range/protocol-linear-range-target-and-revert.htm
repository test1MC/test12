        <p>Follow the instructions in this section if total protein staining of the membrane will be used as the internal loading control for QWB normalization. For normalization with a housekeeping protein, see Section <MadCap:xref href="protocol-linear-range-of-two-proteins.htm#top" class="XreftoParanum">I. </MadCap:xref></p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Perform a Western blot with a serial dilution of sample (an 8-12 point, two-fold serial dilution is a good place to start).</p>
                <p class="note">Make sure the dilution series includes sample loading amounts above and below the amount of sample you expect to load in each lane.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Prepare samples to be loaded on the gel with sample loading buffer.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Denature sample by heating at 95 °C for 3 min (or 70 °C for 10 min).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Load a uniform amount of sample protein in each lane.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Separate sample proteins by SDS-PAGE.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Transfer proteins to blotting membrane.</p>

                <p>Image the membrane in the 700 nm channel with an Odyssey<sup>®</sup> imaging system (Classic, CLx, or Fc).</p>
                <p>Adjust settings so that no saturation appears in the bands to be quantified.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Rinse membrane briefly with water, and proceed immediately to blocking and immunodetection steps.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Perform immunoblotting using IRDye<sup>®</sup> 800CW conjugated secondary antibody to detect the target protein.</p>
