        <ul style="list-style:none;">
            <li><strong>Linear range of sample loading.</strong> This range must be determined individually for the target protein and internal loading control. Compare the linear ranges to determine the amount of sample you should load to produce a linear response for both target and control.</li>
            <li><strong>Housekeeping proteins.</strong> With two proteins of very different abundance, such as a target protein and highly expressed HKP loading control, it is absolutely critical to detect both proteins within the linear range. If the HKP is not detected in the linear range of sample loading, these strong bands will be underestimated and normalization will not be accurate.</li>
            <li><strong>Quantification of faint bands.</strong> Faint bands that are near the lower limit of detection generally have much larger coefficients of variation. They are difficult to discriminate from membrane background and may not be statistically significant. The high variability of faint bands introduces error that may affect data analysis and interpretation.</li>
            <li><strong>Antibody validation.</strong> Two-color Western blot detection requires careful selection of primary and secondary antibodies to prevent cross-reactivity. Always perform single-color control blots first to verify antibody specificity, and to identify possible interference from background bands.</li>
