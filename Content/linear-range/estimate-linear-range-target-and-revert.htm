Shaded regions indicate the range of sample loading that produces a linear signal response on each graph. Linear range boundaries may be different for the target and total protein stain.

Use a secondary y-axis to plot the 700 nm and 800 nm signals on the same graph.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>For your experiments, choose a level of sample loading that falls in the middle of the combined linear range for the target protein and <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/revert_tps.flsnp" /> (X, <MadCap:xref href="#linear-protocol-appropriate-LR-target-TPS" class="figure-x">Figure 2</MadCap:xref>). Avoid working near the boundaries of the combined range.</p>
