        <p>Follow the instructions in this section if a housekeeping protein will be used as the internal loading control for QWB normalization. This section also applies to normalization with a pan-specific antibody for analysis of phosphorylation or other post-translational modifications. If you plan to use a total protein stain for normalization, see Section <MadCap:xref href="protocol-linear-range-target-and-revert.htm#top" class="XreftoParanum">I. </MadCap:xref></p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Perform a Western blot with a serial dilution of sample (an 8-12 point, two-fold serial dilution is a good place to start).</p>
                <p class="note">Make sure the dilution series includes sample loading amounts above and below the amount of sample you expect to load in each lane.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Prepare samples to be loaded on the gel with sample loading buffer.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Denature sample by heating at 95 °C for 3 min (or 70 °C for 10 min).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Load a uniform amount of sample protein in each lane.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Separate protein by SDS-PAGE.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Transfer proteins to immobilizing membrane.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Perform Western blot detection of target protein and HKP, according to the <i>Near-Infrared Western Blot Detection Protocol</i> (<a href="www.licor.com/NIRWesternProtocol">licor.com/NIRWesternProtocol</a>; LI-COR).</p>
                <p class="note">Use the 800 nm channel to detect the target protein. This channel provides the lowest membrane background and will maximize the sensitivity of detection.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Image membrane with an Odyssey imaging system (Classic, CLx or Fc) in the 700 and 800 nm channels.</p>
                <p>Adjust settings so that no saturation appears in the bands to be quantified.</p>
            </li>
