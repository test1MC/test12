        <h1>Image Studio 5.2 Upgrade</h1>
        <p>
            <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/Image_Studio_5_2_5.flsnp" /> contains fixes for bugs in Image Studio 5.0.</p>
        <p class="warning">If you are currently using Image Studio 5.0, please upgrade <b>all</b> installations of Image Studio (lite and full) you and your group use from 5.0 to 5.2.</p>
        <MadCap:dropDown>
            <MadCap:dropDownHead>
                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Why is the upgrade recommended?</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>Two primary reasons:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>Image Studio 5.0 contained a bug that sometimes prevented Work Areas from previous Image Studio versions from opening properly. <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/Image_Studio_5_2_5.flsnp" /> fixes the bug.</p>
                        <p class="note">
                            Once a Work Area has been opened in 5.2, do not try to open it in any previous version of Image Studio. This is one reason you should upgrade all your installations of Image Studio to 5.2.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Image Studio 5.2 fixes a bug in Image Studio 5.0 relating to Zip File exports. If you exported a Zip File without first saving changes, your changes would be included in the exported Zip File but not saved to the Work Area.</li>
                </ol>
