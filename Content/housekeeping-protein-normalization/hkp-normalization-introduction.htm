        <p>
            <p>Housekeeping proteins (HKPs) are routinely used as loading controls for Western blot normalization. Accurate normalization requires stable expression of the HKP across all experimental conditions and treatments. Because HKP normalization relies on a single indicator of sample loading, variation in HKP expression leads to inconsistent estimation of sample loading and introduces experimental error that may alter data analysis.</p>
            <p>For widely-used HKPs (such as actin, tubulin, and GAPDH), stable expression has generally been assumed. However, expression of common HKPs is now known to vary in response to certain experimental conditions, including cell confluence, disease state, drug treatment, and cell or tissue type.</p>
            <p class="warning">Before an HKP is used for Western blot normalization, stable expression must be validated for the specific experimental context and treatments.  For more information, see the <i>Housekeeping Protein Validation Protocol</i> (<a href="http://www.licor.com/HKP-Validation">licor.com/HKP-Validation</a>; LI-COR).</p>
            <p>This protocol describes how to use a housekeeping protein for Western blot normalization and quantitative analysis.</p>
